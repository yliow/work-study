 Because we are such advanced life forms obviously we don't want
 to write $xxxxxxxxxx$. So \ldots

 \begin{defn}  
 The definition of $x^k$ for $n \geq 0$ is obvious.
 Here's the formal definition using recursion:
 \begin{tightlist}
  \item $x^0 = \epsilon$
  \item $x^{n+1} = x x^n$ if $n \geq 0$.
 \end{tightlist}
 \qed
\end{defn}
