\section{Concatenation Operation}

\begin{defn}
Define the concatenation operation as following. If $x_0 \cdots
x_m$ and $y_0 \cdots y_n$ are strings over $\Sigma$ where $x_i,y_j
\in \Sigma_\ep$, then
\[
 (x_0 \cdots x_m) \cdot (y_0 \cdots y_n)
 \defeq x_0 \cdots x_m y_0 \cdots y_n
\]
We will also write $xy$ instead of $x\cdot y$.
\end{defn}

Sanity check: Are you really sure that all the above are
consistent? No circular definitions? Sure?


(Some authors write $x||y$ instead of $xy$, but I don't like it. I
sometimes see this in the context of cryptography.)
