\section{Formal Introduction to Languages (uh-oh)}

Through this section, $\Sigma$ is a finite nonempty set. (What's
the point of an empty set?? The only language you get out of it is
the empty language!)

\begin{defn}
$\epsilon$ is the \defterm{empty string}. The standard symbol for
this empty string is $\epsilon$. Obviously we assume that $\epsilon$
is not a symbol in $\Sigma$! (Some books use $\lambda$ and some
authors call it the null string). For convenience we write
$\Sigma_\epsilon$ for $\Sigma \cup \{\epsilon\}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A string (defined) over $\Sigma$ is an expression of the form
\[ x_0 x_1 x_2 \ldots x_n \]
where $x_i \in \Sigma_\ep$. The set of all strings over $\Sigma$
is denote by $\Sigma^*$. We also define
\[
 \Sigma^+ \defeq \Sigma^* - \{ \ep \}
\]
\end{defn}
