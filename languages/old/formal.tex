\section{Formal Introduction to Languages (uh-oh)}

Through this section, $\Sigma$ is a finite nonempty set. (What's
the point of an empty set?? The only language you get out of it is
the empty language or the language with only the empty string!)

\begin{defn}
$\epsilon$ is the \defone{empty string}. The standard symbol for
this empty string is $\epsilon$. Obviously we assume that $\epsilon$
is not a symbol in $\Sigma$! (Some books use $\lambda$ and some
authors call it the null string). For convenience we write
$\Sigma_\epsilon$ for $\Sigma \cup \{\epsilon\}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  A
  \defone{string}
  or
  \sidebarskip{12pt}\defone{word}
  (defined) over $\Sigma$ is an expression of the form
  \[
  x_0 x_1 x_2 \ldots x_{n-1}
  \]
  where $x_i \in \Sigma_\ep$ (i.e., $x_i$ is either $\ep$ or is in
  $\Sigma$.)
  The set of all strings over $\Sigma$
  is denote by $\Sigma^*$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
We also define
\[
 \Sigma^+ \defeq \Sigma^* - \{ \ep \}
\]
\end{defn}
