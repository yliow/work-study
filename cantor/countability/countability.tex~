\section{Countability} \label{S:countability}

Throughout this section, $X$ is a set. Recall that we defined
$|X|$ for finite sets. Now we want to talk about infinite sets.

\begin{defn}
 Let $X$ be a set.
 We say that $X$ is \defterm{countable} iff
 either $X$ is finite or there is a bijection between $X$ and
 $\N$.
 $X$ is \defterm{uncountable} iff it is not countable.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets. We write $|X| \leq |Y|$ iff there is a
1--1 function $X \rightarrow Y$. If there is a bijection between
$X$ and $Y$, we write $|X| = |Y|$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
$X$ is infinite iff $|X| = |X - \{x\}|$ for any $x \in X$.
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
Prove that $\N$ is countably infinite.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Let $E$ be the set of even numbers. Since $E$ is just half of $\N$,
we must have $|E| < |\N|$, right? WRONG! Prove that $|E| = |\N|$.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
OK, but surely, $|\Q| > |\N|$, right? WRONG! Prove that $|\Q| =
|\N|$.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Prove that $|\N \times \N| = |\N|$. In fact $|\N^k| = |\N|$ for any
integer $k>0$. More generally, suppose $X_0, \ldots, X_n$ are
countable sets, prove that $X_0 \times \cdots \times X_n$ is also
countable.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Let $X_0, \ldots, X_n$ be countable sets. Prove that
$\bigcup_{i=0}^n X_i$ and $\bigcap_{i=0}^n X_i$ are both
countable.
\end{ex}

So what about $\R$? $\R$ is in fact uncountable. As a matter of
fact, the interval $[0,1)$ is uncountable. The method of proof for
this theorem is very important. Some people call this the
dovetailing method. By the way, this is your first real theorem.

\begin{thm} {\bf (Cantor)}
$[0,1)$ is uncountable.
\end{thm}

Proof. Every real number in $[0,1)$ looks like a decimal with no
integer part. For instance $0.123 \in [0,1)$.

We prove by contradiction. Suppose it is countable. So let's say
the complete list of real numbers in $[0,1)$ is given by the list
$x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots$. Let's construct a real number $x \in
[0,1)$ which is {\bf not} in the above list. This will give us a
contradiction. Right?

OK. So let's begin. I will construct $x$ by giving you the decimal
expansion. I will also\lq\lq avoid" the list $x_1, x_2, x_3\ldots$
so that $x$ is not any of them.

Let's begin by \lq\lq avoiding" $x_1$. Now $x_1$ is of the form
$0.a...$ where $a$ is a digit from 0 to 9. If $a=0$, I will say
that $x=0.1\ldots$; otherwise, I will say that $x=0.0\ldots$. So
obviously $x \neq x_1$.

But now you see the trick. I'll repeat this for $x_2$. Say $x_2 =
0.bc\ldots$, then the second decimal place of $x$ is $1$ if $c=0$;
otherwise the second decimal place of $x$ is $0$.

So let's have a formal proof. Suppose $x_i$ is
\[ x_i = 0.x_{i,1}x_{i,2}x_{i,3} \ldots x_{i,i} \ldots \]
for $i=1,2,3,\ldots$. Then we let $x$ be the number
\[ x = 0.y_1 y_2 y_3 \ldots y_i \ldots \]
where
\[ y_i =
\begin{cases}
 0 \text{ if } x_{i,i} \neq 0 \cr
 1 \text{ if } x_{i,i} = 0 \cr
\end{cases}
\]
Note in particular that $y_i \neq x_{i,i}$ for all $i>0$. Then $x
\neq x_i$ for all $i$. Why? Otherwise say $x = x_i$ for some $i$.
But that implies that they have the same decimal expansion. In
other words
\[ y_j = x_{i,j} \]
for all $j$. But by construction,
\[ y_i \neq x_{i,i} \]
Contradiction!!!

But wait, there's a ... {\bf hole} in the proof. We assumed that if
two real numbers are the same, they must then have the same decimal
expansion. Is that true?

\begin{ex}
Show that $0.09999\ldots = 0.1$ numerically although they are
written differently. [Hint: Remember geometric series?
\[ a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \cdots = \frac{a}{1-r} \]
Don't just stare at it. Try to use this formula.]
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
 Prove Cantor's Theorem. (The above proof is almost correct.)
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Prove that there are uncountably many functions $\N \rightarrow
\{0,1\}$. [Hint: Dovetail]
\end{ex}


\begin{ex}
\begin{mylist}
 \item We already know from a previous exercise that a finite
 product of countable sets is countable. Suppose $X_0, X_1, \ldots$
 are countable. Is $X_0 \times X_1 \times X_2 \times \cdots$
 countable?
 \item What about the countable union of countable sets? (I hope the
 meaning is obvious.)
\end{mylist}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Prove that $P(\N)$ is uncountable.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
 \begin{mylist}
 \item Prove that there are countable many C++ programs.
 \item Since there number of functions from $\N$ to $\{0,1\}$ is
  uncountable, what does that tell you?
 \end{mylist}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Prove that for any set $X$, $|X| < |P(X)|$.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Note that the above result implies that there there is no \lq\lq
largest" set since
\[ |X| < |P(X)| < |P(P(X))| < \cdots \]
In particular we have $|\N| < |P(\N)|$. An interesting question is
whether you can find a set $X$ such that
\[ |\N| < |X| < |P(\N)| \]
In other words, is there anything in between $|\N|$ and $|P(\N)|$?
In some books you will find the symbol $\aleph_0$ which stands for
$|\N|$; we also write $2^\aleph_0$ for $|P(\N)|$. The orders of
infinite sets together with integers are called ordinals. So the
above questions can be rephrased as whether there is any ordinal $x$
such that $\aleph_0 < x < 2^{\aleph_0}$.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex} Prove or disprove the following. Let $X,X', Y,Y'$ be
sets. Let $\hom(X,Y)$ denote the set of functions from $X$ to $Y$.
(You've seen this before; I've just replaced
$\hom_{\operatorname{Sets}}$ with $\hom$)
 \begin{mylist}
  \item $X \subseteq X' \implies |\hom(X,Y)| \leq |\hom(X',Y)|$
  \item $X \subsetneq X' \implies |\hom(X,Y)| < |\hom(X',Y)|$
  \item $Y \subseteq Y' \implies |\hom(X,Y)| \leq |\hom(X,Y')|$
  \item $Y \subsetneq Y' \implies |\hom(X,Y)| < |\hom(X',Y)|$
 \end{mylist}
\end{ex}
