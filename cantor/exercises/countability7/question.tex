Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be countable sets. Prove that
$\bigcup_{i=1}^n X_i$ and $\bigcap_{i=1}^n X_i$ are both
countable.
In fact if you have countably many countable sets,
$X_1, X_2, \ldots$, then
$\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty X_i$ is countable.
One would say
\lq\lq a countable union of countable sets is countable".
