STL map is essentially the same as STL set except that
the values in the tree are (key, value) pairs (using \verb!std::pair!).
This allows you to store for instance (student id, student info)
and you search for a student by his/her student id.
When a container store (key, value) pairs, the container is
frequently called an associative container (it contains
an association between key and data.)

\verb!std::multimap! is the same as \verb!std::map!,
except that the keys can repeat.
