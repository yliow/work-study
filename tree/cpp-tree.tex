\verb!std::set! is a balanced BST. This is usually implemented
with the red-black tree data structure, which is roughly a balanced
tree like the AVL. (AVL was discovered before red-black trees.)
The key for \verb!std::set! must be unique.

\verb!std::multiset! is the same as \verb!std::set!,
except that the keys can repeat.
