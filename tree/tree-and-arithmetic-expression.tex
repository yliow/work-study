\sectionthree{Trees and arithmetic expressions}
\begin{python0}
from solutions import *; clear()
\end{python0}

Trees can be used to represent arithmetic expressions.
For instance look at this:

\input{stdout09.tex}

The value obtained from \lq\lq evaluating'' the tree is this:
\[
\texttt{(((3 - 5) * (7 \% 2)) + ((0 * 7) + 1))}
\]

You can think of the tree as a device that can be used to describe
order of operations, or if you like, it's a device that can be 
used to play the role of parentheses.
So really, you have been doing trees since elementary school, right?

\begin{ex}
Assuming the above tree is a tree with node that contain characters,
Write a function to traverse the tree and produce the 
string
\[
\texttt{(((3 - 5) * (7 \% 2)) + ((0 * 7) + 1))}
\]
What tree traversal would you use?
\qed
\end{ex}
