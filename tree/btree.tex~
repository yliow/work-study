\section{$k$-ary trees and B-trees}

Recall that a $k$--ary tree is just a tree where node can have
at most $k$ children.
So a binary tree is a $2$--ary tree.
Recall that the height of a binary tree of size $n$ is in the best case
\[
\log_2 n
\]
and in the worse case
\[
n
\]
In general if you have a $k$--ary tree, in the best case the height is
\[
\log_k n
\]
and $n$ in the worse case.

It's not difficult to imagine that the same idea used in a
binary search tree can be applied to a
$k$--ary search tree. For instance, in a 5--ary tree would look like

\begin{python}
from bpt0 import *
\end{python}

The first leaf has keys $ \leq 5$,
the second has leaves with keys $> 5$ and $\leq 10$,
the third has leaves with keys $> 10$ and $\leq 25$, etc.

Refer to CISS430 for more information on this variable of the binary
search tree.
