  Using the maxheap (using an array) from the previous question,
  remove the following values one after another left to right:
  \[
    1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 4, 2, 0, 8, 9
  \]
  Call the array \texttt{x} and use integer variable \texttt{len}
  for the length of \texttt{x}.
  Of course initially \texttt{len} is 10.
  Make sure that after each delete, the tree is complete after each delete and 
  the leaves
  at the lowest level are all on the left.
