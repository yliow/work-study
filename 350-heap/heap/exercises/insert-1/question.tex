  Starting with this maxheap:

\input{stdout34.tex}


Do the following assuming that the array implementation
of the above heap is an array of size 20.
\begin{tightlist}
\item Draw the array implementation of the above maxheap.
\item Insert \texttt{5}. Draw the maxheap after the insert
and after each necessary swap (technically, until all the swaps are done
the tree is not a max heap). Draw the array implementation
after each swap.
\item Do the same with \texttt{15}.
\item Do the same with \texttt{11}.
\item Do the same with \texttt{22}.
\end{tightlist}
