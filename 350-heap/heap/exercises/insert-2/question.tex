Starting with an empty \textit{min} heap.
Do the following, drawing the heap and the array implementation.
\begin{tightlist}
  \item Insert \texttt{10}.
  \item Insert \texttt{15}.
  \item Insert \texttt{5}.
  \item Insert \texttt{2}.
  \item Insert \texttt{8}.
  \item Insert \texttt{0}.
  \item Insert \texttt{5}.
\end{tightlist}
(First, you want to study the operations for maxheap very carefully.
Then, you translate the operations to the case of minheap.)
