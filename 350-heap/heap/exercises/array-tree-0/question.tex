  \item Locate the index position of the value \texttt{1}.
  What is the index and value of the left child of \texttt{1}?
  What is the index and value of the right child of \texttt{1}?
  \item What are the values of all the leaves?
  \item What are the values of all the nodes with degree 1, i.e., with 1
  child?
  \item Draw the corresponding tree.
