  Analyze and implement a FIFOMinHeap.
  This is a minheap that is FIFO on values with the
  same priority.
  In other words, if two values
  of the same priority
  are inserted into a minheap,
  then value inserted earlier will be
  removed before the other value.
  (There are at least two different ways of doing
  the above.)
