Continuing the implementation of the heap ADT using functions,
implement the increase-key and decrease-key
functions:
\begin{console}
int x;
std::vector< int > heap;

heap.resize(5);
heap[0] = 5;
heap[1] = 7;
heap[2] = 8;
heap[3] = 10;
heap[4] = 2;
maxheap_build(heap);      // [10, 7, 8, 5, 2]

maxheap_increasekey(heap, 2, 12); // heap[2] is changed
                          // to 12. heap has to be
                          // reorganized to become
                          // maxheap again.
                          
maxheap_decreasekey(heap, 2, 0); // heap[2] is changed
                          // to 0. heap has to be
                          // reorganized to become
                          // maxheap again.
\end{console}
