  Suppose that in maxheap, there are two 5's.
  One 5 was inserted at 9AM and the second 5 was inserted
  at 10AM.
  If I delete the maximum value of the heap
  until the heap is empty,
  will the 5 inserted at 9AM be deleted
  from the heap
  before or after the 5 inserted at 10AM?
  Or are both scenarios possible?
