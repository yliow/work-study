The minheap basically have pointers going to values smaller
than the root.
But there's no organization about the children.
What if the children are organized?
What if left subtree have values $\leq k$ and 
right subtree have values $> k$?
Say root is 10.
Insert 5 goes into left child first. $k$ is set fo $5$.
What happens with insert 3?
We can change the left, right pointers.
So that left points to 3, right points to 5 
and $k = 4$?
Are there such trees?
After insert 1 and 2 which will go into 3,
what if I insert 0?

What is we do lazy extract-max?
Suppose we extract-root and do not heapify and only heapify during the 
second extract-root?
What is the heapify like if we delete two roots?
