\section{Minimization} \label{S:minimization}

Here's the aim: Let $M$ be a DFA. Can we find another DFA $M'$ such
that
\begin{itemize}
 \item $L(M') = L(M)$
 \item $M'$ is a DFA with the smallest number of states satisfying
 the above.
\end{itemize}

First we'll find a smaller DFA. Later we'll prove that it's the
smallest using Myhill-Nerode's Theorem.



\subsection{DFA Minimization}

Throughout this section, $M = (\Sigma,Q,q_0,F,\delta)$ will be DFA
where $Q = \{q_0,\ldots,q_{n-1}\}$

The idea is to collapse states $\ldots$ EQUIVALENCE RELATION TO THE
RESCUE!

Recall $\delta^* : Q \times \Sigma^* \rightarrow Q$ is defined as:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\delta^*(q,\ep) = q$
 \item $\delta^*(q,ax) = \delta^*( \delta(q,a), x)$
\end{itemize}
[Put this somewhere else.]

\begin{defn}
For any $q,q' \in Q$, write $q \equiv_M q'$ iff
\[
 \delta^*(q,x) \in F \iff \delta^*(q',x) \in F
\]
for all $x \in \Sigma^*$.
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
Prove that $\equiv_M$ is an equivalence relation on $Q$.
\end{ex}

The problem with this definition is that the condition involves
checking with infinitely many strings $x \in \Sigma^*$. So let's
look at the above definition with $x$ replaced by $a \in \Sigma$.

Note that if $q,q' \in Q$ and $r=\delta(q,a)$, $r'=\delta(q',a)$.
Then
\[
 r \not\equiv_M r' \implies q \not\equiv_M q'
\]


\begin{thm}\label{T:dfaminimization}
 Consider the following algorithm: Let $|Q| = n$
 \texttt{
  \begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
  \item[(1)]   I $\leftarrow$ $\{$ (i,j) | 0 $\leq$ i < j $\leq$ n-1 $\}$
  \item[(2)]   for (i,j) $\in$ I:
  \item[(2.1)] \quad\quad D[i,j] $\leftarrow$ 0
  \item[(2.2)] \quad\quad S[i,j] $\leftarrow$ $\emptyset$
  \item[(3)]   for (i,j) $\in$ I:
  \item[(4)]   \quad\quad if D[i,j] == 0:
  \item[(4.1)] \quad\quad\quad\quad if $\exists$ a $\in$ $\Sigma$ such that $\delta$(
  \end{itemize}
 }
 At the end of the algorithm, for each $(i,j) \in I$
 \[
  q_i \equiv_M q_j \iff D[i,j]=1
 \]
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
Let $Q'$ denote the equivalence classes of $Q$ under $\equiv_M$.
Define $\delta' : Q' \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q'$ as follows:
\[
 \delta'([q],a) = [ \delta(q,a) ]
\]
Let $F' = \{\, [q] \,|\, q \in F \,\}$ and $q'_0 = [q_0]$. Then $M'
= (\Sigma,Q',q'_0,F',\delta')$ is a DFA such that $L(M) = L(M')$.
\end{thm}




\subsection{Myhill-Nerode Theorem}

\begin{ex}
 Let $L$ be any language over $\Sigma$. Prove the following.
 Define $\equiv_L$ as follows: Let $x,y \in \Sigma^*$.
 Then $x \equiv_L y$ iff for each $w \in \Sigma^*$, either both
 $xw,yw$ are in $L$ or $xw,yw$ are not in $L$. Prove that
 $\equiv_L$ is an equivalence relation. We will write $[x]_L$ for
 the equivalence class of $x$ under $\equiv_L$.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
 Suppose $L$ is a regular language over $\Sigma$ accepted by a DFA
 $M$. Define $\equiv_M$ as follows. Let $x,y \in \Sigma^*$. Then
 $x \equiv_M y$ iff $x$ and $y$ halt at the same state in $M$.
 Formally, we can define the state reached by $x$ as $q(x)$, i.e.,
 \[ (q_0,x) \vdash (q(x),\ep) \]
 Then $x \equiv_M y$ iff $q(x) = q(y)$.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item[\textup{(a)}] Prove that $\equiv_M$ is an equivalence
  relation. We will write $[x]_M$ for the equivalence class of $x$
  under $\equiv_M$.
  \item[\textup{(b)}] $\equiv_M$ has finitely many equivalence classes.
 \end{itemize}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
 Let $M$ be a DFA over $\Sigma$ and $L = L(M)$.
 Let $x \in \Sigma^*$ and consider the equivalence class
 $x\equiv_L$ and $x \equiv_M$.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Prove that $[x]_M \subseteq [x]_L$.
  \item Prove that $\equiv_L$ has finite many equivalence classes
  \item Let $n_L$ denote the number of equivalence classes for
  $\equiv_L$. Then $n_L \leq |Q|$ where $Q$ is the number of
  states in $M$.
 \end{itemize}
\end{ex}


\begin{ex}
 Let $L$ be a language over $\Sigma$ and let $\{x_i\equiv_L \,|\, i \in I
 \}$ be a partition of $L$ where $\ep$ is among the $x_i$.
 For simplicity let $q_i^L =
 x_i\equiv_L$ for $i in I$ and let $Q_L = \{q_i \,|\, i \in I\}$.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item For $x \in \Sigma^*$, define $\delta_L(q_i,x) =
  (x_ix)\equiv_L$. Prove that $\delta$ is well-defined.
  \item Define $q_0 = \ep\equiv_L$. Let $F_L$ be the of $q_i \in Q$
  such that $q_i = x_i \equiv_L$ and $x_i \in L$. Prove that
  $(\Sigma, Q_L, q_0, F_L, \delta_L)$ is a DFA.
  \item Prove that $L(M_L) = L$.
  \item Prove the $M_L$ is a DFA accepting $L$ with the smallest
  number of states.
 \end{itemize}
\end{ex}


Let $M$ be a DFA over $\Sigma$. Let $x \in \Sigma^*$. We let
$q(x)$ denote the final state reached by $x$, in other words:
\[
 (q_0,x \vdash^* (q(x),\ep)
\]
Right?


Of course $\{q(x) \in Q \,|\, x \in \Sigma^* \}$ is the set of all
states that all strings can reach. Obviously
\[
 \{q(x) \in Q \,|\, x \in \Sigma^* \} \subseteq Q
\]
Of course you can think of $q \Sigma^* \rightarrow Q$ as a function.
Suppose $Q = \{q_0, \ldots, q_{n-1}\}$. Then $q(q_i)$ is the set of
strings that would halt at state $q_i$. Note that $\{q^{-1}(q_i)
\,|\, q_i \in Q\}$ are disjoint subsets of $\Sigma^*$. Obviously
$\bigcup_{q_i \in F} q(q_i) = L$, i.e., $\{q^{-1}(q_i) \,|\, q_i \in
F\}$ is a partiton of $L$.


Can I somehow remove my dependency on $Q$? I've rewritten $L$ in
terms of the union of certain disjoint sets $q^{-1}(q_i)$'s but
these sets still depend on states $q_i$, i.e., the still depend on
$M$.


Now since $\{q^{-1}(q_i) \,|\, q_i \in Q\}$ is a partition of
$\Sigma^*$, it gives rise to an equivalence relation. Recall how to
define an equivalence relation given a partition. Let $x,y \in
\Sigma^*$, then $x \equiv y$ iff $q(x)=q(y)$.


Note that if $q(x) = q(y)$ then obviously $q(xw) = q(yw)$ for any
$w \in \Sigma^*$. So? This seems useless since the new fact still
depends on function $q$ which depends on the existence of $M$.


But wait!!! Look at the follow:
\begin{itemize}
 \item{(1)} $q(xw) = q(yw)$ for any $w \in \Sigma^*$
 \item{(2)} Either $xw, xy \in L$ or $xw,xy \notin L$ for any $w \in \Sigma^*$
\end{itemize}
Let $[]_M$ denote equivalence classes under (1) and $[]_L$ denote
that for (2). Clearly $[x]_M \subseteq [x]_L$!


This tells us that bunches of equivalence classes under $\equiv_M$
will form a single equivalence class under $\equiv_L$. Hence the
number of equivalence classes under $\equiv_M$ is $\geq$ number of
equivalence classes under $\equiv_L$. Let $n_L$ and $n_M$ denote
the number of equivalence classes under $\equiv_L$ and $\equiv_M$
respectively. Then
\[
    n_L \leq n_M
\]
In fact you can define a DFA using $\equiv_L$!!! The equivalence
classes form the states. Complete the rest. Call this DFA $M_L$.


Now prove that $L(M_L) = L(M)$. Why is $M_L$ the DFA with the
smallest number of states again?

\begin{thm}\label{T:myhillnerode} {\bf(Myhill-Nerode)}
 TFAE
 \begin{itemize}
  \item{\textup{(a)}} $L$ is regular over $\Sigma$
  \item{\textup{(b)}} There is a right invariant equivalence
  relation on $\Sigma^*$ such that $L$ is the union of a subset of
  the equivalence classes of $\equiv$
  \item{\textup{(c)}} $\equiv_L$ has finitely many equuivalence
  classes
 \end{itemize}
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}
Let $M$ be a DFA and
\end{thm}


\begin{cor}
 If $\equiv_L$ has infinitely equivalence classes, then $L$ is not
 regular
\end{cor}
