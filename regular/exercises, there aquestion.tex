Prove that $\equiv_M$ is an equivalence relation on $\Sigma^*$.
Therefore $\Sigma^*$ is partitioned into equivalence classes of
strings. We will write $[x]_M$ for the equivalence class containing
$x$, i.e.,
\[
 [x]_M = \{ y \in \Sigma^* \,|\, x \equiv_M y \}
\]
We will write $\ind(\equiv_M)$ for the number of equivalence classes
of $\Sigma^*$ under $\equiv_M$.
