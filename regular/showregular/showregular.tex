\section{Methods to Prove a Language is Regular or not Regular}

Here's a quick summary of methods to show a language $L$ is
regular:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Construct a DFA or NFA and show that the language accepted
 is the same as $L$. Remember that an NFA is usually easier.
 \item Construct a regex and show that the language accepted is
 $L$
 \item Use closure rules
\end{itemize}

To show a language is not regular
\begin{itemize}
 \item Use pumping lemma
 \item Assume it is regular, use closure rules to simplify it to
 something that you know is not regular
 \item Assume it is regular, use closure rules to simplify it, and
 use pumping lemma to show it is not regular
\end{itemize}

If you're not told if the language is regular or not, just
remember that a regular language is accepted by a DFA with
finitely many states. If you have to assume that the machine needs
to remember arbitrarily huge amount of information, then it's very
likely not regular. For instance the language $\{a^nb^n \,|\, n
\geq 0\}$ is not regular. However note that sometimes it's because
of your bad design that requires infinitely many states! You can't
blame your bad design on the language!
