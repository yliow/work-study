  \begin{tightlist}
  \item Let $L_1 = \{a^n b^n \mid n \geq 0\}$.
    Prove that $L_1$ is not a regular language.
  \item
    Let $L_2 = \{w \in \Sigma^* \mid |w|_a, |w|_b \text{ both even}\}$.
    What is the size of the smallest DFA?
    Construct a minimal DFA for $L_2$.
    Note that the results above only tells you a lower bound
    on the number of states of a DFA for $L_2$.
    It does not say that the number stated is attained.
    The results above also does not tell you how to construct a DFA.
