  Again let
  \[
  L_1 = \{a^n b^n \mid n \geq 0\}
  \]
  \begin{tightlist}
  \item Are $\ep, a$ $L_1$--separable? $L_1$--distinguishable?
  \item Are $aa, bb$ $L_1$--separable? $L_1$--distinguishable?
  \item Are $ab, aabb$ $L_1$--distinguishable? $L_1$--distinguishable?
  \item Find an example of $x,y$ such that
    $xz, yz$ are $L_1$--separated for $z$ and
    $xz', yz'$ are not $L_1$--separated for $z'$.
    (So you need to find four strings $x,y,z,z'$.)
  \item Find three strings which are pairwise $L_1$--distinguishable.
    How about four? Five?
  \item Is this true? Given any positive $n \geq 2$,
    it's possible to find $n$ strings which are
    pairwise $L_1$--distinguishable.
  \end{tightlist}
