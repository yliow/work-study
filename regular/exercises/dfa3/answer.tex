  The $\delta*$ computation is
  \begin{align*}
    \delta^*(q_0 aba)
    &= (\delta(q_0, a), ba) = (q_0, ba) \\
    &= (\delta(q_0, b), a) = (q_1, a) \\
    &= (\delta(q_1, a), \ep) = (q_0, \ep)
  \end{align*}
  I stop at this point since the string now is $\ep$.
  The last state is $q_0$ which is not an accept state.
  Therefore
  $aba$ is not accepted by the DFA.

  Comparing the above to
    \begin{align*}
    q_0 aba
    \vdash \delta(q_0, a), ba) = (q_0, ba) \\ 
    \vdash \delta(q_0, b), a) = (q_1, a) \\
    \vdash \delta(q_1, a), \ep) = (q_0, \ep)
  \end{align*}
    you see that using $\vdash$ notation to relate
    ID is mathematically the same as
    using $\delta$.
