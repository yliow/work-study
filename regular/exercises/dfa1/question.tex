  Write down the ID computation for $aba$. Is $aba$ accepted by the DFA?

  \SOLUTION
  The ID computation is
  \begin{align*}
    (q_0, aba)
    &\vdash (\delta(q_0, a), ba) = (q_0, ba) \\ 
    &\vdash (\delta(q_0, b), a) = (q_1, a) \\
    &\vdash (\delta(q_1, a), \ep) = (q_0, \ep)
  \end{align*}
  $q_0$ is not an accept state. Therefore $aba$ is not accepted.
