  Let $M$ be an DFA.
  Is it clear that the diagram of $M$ is also a diagram
  for an NFA, say call it $N$?
  If is clear that $L(N) = L(M)$?
  This is all very informal.
  That's because we don't have a formal definition of an NFA
  yet other than a diagram.
  (Later you'll see that the converse is true.)
