Here's the solution.
Let $\delta$ denote the transition function of $N$.
Note that 
\begin{align*}
  \delta(q_0, \epsilon) = \{\} \\
  \delta(q_0, a) = \{\} \\
  \delta(q_0, b) = \{\} 
\end{align*}
First of all the states are labeled as all the subsets of $\{q_0\}$.

\input{stdout24.tex}

The start state is the $\epsilon$-closure of $\{q_0\}$.
However in $N$, there are no $\epsilon$--transitions out of 
$q_0$.
So the $\epsilon$-closure of $\{q_0\}$ is in fact $\{q_0\}$, i.e.
$\overline{\{q_0\}} = \{q_0\}$
The $\DFA$ is now this:

\input{stdout25.tex}

Now I will compute the $a$--transition of the state $\{q_0\}$.
Let $\delta^\DFA$ denote the transition function of the $\DFA$
that we're building.
Then
\begin{align*}
\delta( \{q_0, a\} ) 
&= \overline{ \bigcup_{q \in \{q_0\}} \delta(q, a)} \\
&= \overline{ \delta(q_0, a) } \\
&= \overline{ \emptyset } \\
&= \emptyset
\end{align*}
The (incomplete) $\DFA$ now looks like this:

\input{stdout26.tex}

Using the same reasoning we have

\input{stdout27.tex}

It's easy to see that in the DFA, the $a$--
and $b$--transitions from the state $\{\}$ goes back to itself.
Therefore the completed DFA is this:
