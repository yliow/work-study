\begin{tightlist}
\item Draw DFA $M$ over $\Sigma = \{0\}$ such that $L(M) = \{\}$.
\item Next, define this DFA formally.
\item Now, draw a graph where the nodes are $(q, x)$ where
$q$ runs through all the states of your DFA and $x$
runs through all the words $\Sigma^*$ ... wait
that's infinite ... you can't do that.
OK ... just draw $(q, x)$ where $q$ runs over all states
and $x$ runs over all words of length $<= 5$.
Draw directed edges in the graph so that
there's an arrow from $(q,x)$ to $(q', x')$ if
$(q, x) \vdash (q', x')$, i.e., $\delta(q, x) = \delta(q', x')$.
\item Finally graph the graph as the above except that
there's an arrow from $(q, x)$ to $(q', x')$
if $(q, x) \vdash (q', x')$, i.e.,
$\delta^*(q, x) = (q', x')$.
