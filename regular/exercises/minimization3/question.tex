  What is the right definition of isomorphism
  if you want to rename the symbols in alphabets as well?
  (There's only one reasonable definition.)
  The definition should look like this:
  \lq\lq An isomorphism between two DFAs
  $M = (\Sigma, Q, q_0, F, \delta)$
  and
  $M' = (\Sigma', Q', q'_0, F', \delta')$
  is a pair of bijections $f: Q \rightarrow Q'$ and
  $g: \Sigma \rightarrow \Sigma'$ such that ..."
  Complete the definition.
