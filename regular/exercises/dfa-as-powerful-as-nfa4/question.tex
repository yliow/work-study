Design a $\DFA$ that accepts words containing $abab$ or $baba$.
[Hint: It's easier to first design two $\NFA$s, one accepting
words containing $abab$ and another accepting words containing
$baba$.
Next design an $\NFA$ accepting words containing $abab$ or $baba$.
Finally convert this $\NFA$ to a $\DFA$ using the subset construction.
I'll come back and talk about closure operators that will give
you a general method for constructing DFAs and NFAs whenever
the describe of the language contains the word \lq\lq or".]
