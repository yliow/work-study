  Draw a state diagram that accepts the following language
  \[
  L = \{w \in \Sigma^* \mid |w|_a, |w|_b \text{ both even}\}
  \]
  where $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$.
  Here, 
  $|w|_a$ is the number of $a$'s in $w$
  and
  $|w|_b$ is the number of $b$'s in $w$.
  For example $|abaab|_a = 3$ and $|abaab|_b = 2$.
  Therefore $abaab \not\in L$.
  However $abbaaa \in L$.
