The following is the maximum of an array algorithm.
The algorithm computes and stores the maximum of array \verb!x! of size
\verb!n! and stores it in \verb!M!.
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, fontsize=\small]
M = x[0]
for i = 1, 2, ..., n - 1:
    if x[i] > M:
        M = x[i]
\end{Verbatim}
(a) Compute the best runtime where the body of the \verb!if! statement
    is never executed.

(b) Compute the worst runtime (where the body of the \verb!if! statement
    is always executed for each iteration of the loop.
