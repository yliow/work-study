The following algorithm
computes the minimum value in an array \verb!x! of size \verb!n!:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, fontsize=\footnotesize]
m = x[0]
for i = 1, 2, ..., n - 1:
    if x[i] < m:
        m = x[i]
\end{Verbatim}
(a) Compute the best runtime where the body of the \verb!if! statement
    is never executed.

(b) Compute the worst runtime (where the body of the \verb!if! statement
    is always executed for each iteration of the loop.
