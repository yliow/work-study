Unfortunately probability theory is a big mess with no
standard notation.

Note that it's common to use a random variable also as a pdf.
For instance some books will say
\[
\Pr[B(n,p) = k] = \binom{n}{k} p^kq^{n-k}
\]
i.e., $B(n,p)$ is a r.v.
and also
\[
B(n,p)(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^kq^{n-k}
\]
i.e., as a pdf.
Some books put parameters as subscript:
\[
B_{(n,p)}
\]
