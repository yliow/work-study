  You have $m$ $n$--sided fair dice.
  You roll die \#1.
  If your roll \#1 is 3, you get to roll the second
  die 3 times (or you can choose to roll it just once
  or twice).
  Suppose you roll \#2 twice and you get 4.
  That means you can roll your third die 4 times.
  Etc.
  The goal is to maximize the sum of your rolls.
  You have decided that the strategy is to stop rolling
  a die
  if it gives you a 4 or 5 or 6.
  What is the sum?
