The probability of getting a quiz from Dr. Liow during a regular
class meeting is 0.8.
What is the probability of getting 3 quizzes in a row?
Note that what is given is the experiment 
\lq\lq Attend a regular class meeting''.
(analogous to \lq\lq toss a coin'')
The sample space is
\[
S = \{\mathsc{Quiz}, \mathsc{NoQuiz}\}
\]
(analogous to $S= \{\HEAD, \TAIL$\}.)
Let's shorten that to 
\[
S = \{\mathsc{Q}, \mathsc{N}\}
\]
