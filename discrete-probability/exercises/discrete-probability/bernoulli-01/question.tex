A sequence of 10 bits are generated so that the probability
of producing a 0 is 0.1.
\begin{tightlist}
  \item What is the probability of getting 
  a bit string that begins with three 0s.
  Assume that the generation of the bits are
  mutually independent.
  \item What if I change the above to \lq\lq a bit string
  with three 0s''?
  \item What if I change the above to \lq\lq a bit string
  with at least three 0s''?
  \item What if I change the above to \lq\lq a bit string
  with at least three 0s'' and the sequence is not a sequence
  of length 10, but of length 1000?
  \item What if I change the above to \lq\lq a bit string
  with no three consecutive 0s'' and the sequence is not a sequence
  of length 10, but of length 1000?
\end{tightlist}
