  You are at a firing range.
  The target is made up of glass like this:
  \[
    \verb!x = [-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-]!
  \]
  You are not good at shooting and so you fired $k$ shots randomly:
  \[
    \verb!x = [X,-,-,X,-,-,-,X,X,-,-,-,X,-,X,-]!
  \]
  The glass then cracked from each shot to the nearest other shot:
  \[
    \verb!x = [X,X,X,X,-,-,-,X,X,-,-,-,X,X,X,-]!
  \]
  What fraction of the glass is cracked? (Fraction = ratio of \verb!X!s to the size of array.)
