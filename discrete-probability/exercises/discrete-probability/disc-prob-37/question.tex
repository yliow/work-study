  $2n$ men go to the same restaurant, but these men went in as
  pairs of friends:
  the first two are friends, the next two are friends, etc.
  The first pair are not friends of other men.
  When they go home, they receive their hats randomly.
  But they are drunk and did no check their hats.
  When they wake up tomorrow morning, if they did not receive their own hats,
  they can still check with their friend and see if the situation can be improved
  by exchanging their hats, and be happy.
  How many men are happy?
