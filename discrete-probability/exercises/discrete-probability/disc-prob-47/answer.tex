(a) $1/n!$

(b)

(c) $C(n,1)$ for lengths $(1, n-1)$. Then there are two ways to place the two subarrays.
$C(n,2)$ for lengths $(2, n-2)$. Then there are two ways to place the two subarrays.
Etc.
The number of ways to form such arrays is
\[
  \sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} \binom{n}{i} \cdot 2 = 2(2^n - 2)
\]
