  Consider the random experiment of rolling two fair
  dice.
  The sample space is $S = S_1 \times S_2$ where
  $S_i = \{\ONE, \TWO, \ldots, \SIX \}$ ($i = 0, 1$).
  For instance $(\ONE, \TWO) \in S$ is the outcome that the first
  die is $\ONE$ and the second die is $\TWO$.
  The probability is uniform.
  Let $X_1((s_1, s_2)) = s_1$ and $X_2((s_1, s_2)) = s_2$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \li
    What is
    the
    probability of rolling two sixes?
    Before you write down the probability, I
    want you to write
    the
    \lq\lq
    probability of rolling two sixes"
    using the $\Pr$ notation
    using the random variables
    $X_1$ and $X_2$.
    \li
    What is the probability of rolling a sum of
    10?
    Before you write down the probability, I
    want you to write
    the
    \lq\lq
    probability of rolling a sum of 10"
    using the $\Pr$ notation
    using a random variable that you have to define on your own.
  \end{itemize}
