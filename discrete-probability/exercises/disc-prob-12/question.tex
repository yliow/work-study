  So you have decided to be biased when
  you choose your pivot:
  You prefer to choose value in the middle
  of the subarray you are quicksorting.
  In other words while quicksorting \verb!x[i..j]!,
  you prefer \verb!x[(i + j)/2]! (the division is integer
  division.
  You do want the other values to have a chance
  of being picked with equal likelyhood adding up to $0.5$.
  To be more precise,
  you choose \verb!x[(i + j)/2]! with a probability
  of $0.5$ and
  the probability of
  choosing \verb!x[k]! for \verb!k! $\neq$ \verb!(i + j)/2!
  is \verb!(0.5)/(j - i)!.
  Write a quicksort function that selects
  a pivot randomly (with uniform pdf) and then another one that
  selects that prefers the value in the middle as above.
  Run your program and collect data on the average number
  of comparisons for different $n$ (the size of the array
  to be sorted).
  What is the expected number of comparisons for the
  quicksort that prefers the value in the middle?
