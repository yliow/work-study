(a)
There are 36 possible outcomes of rolling two dice are $(a, b)$
for
$1 \leq a \leq 6$, 
$1 \leq b \leq 6$.
Each $(a, b)$ has a probability of $1/36$.
Therefore the probability is $1/36$.

Here's a program to check my computation:
\input{stdout/stdout08a.tex}

(b)
There are 10 cases for getting exactly one six:
$(a, 6)$ for $1 \leq a \leq 5$ or
$(6, b)$ for $1 \leq b \leq 5$.
Therefore the probability is $10/36 = 5/18$.

Here's a program to check my computation:
\input{stdout/stdout08b.tex}

(c)
The probability is $11/36$ since there are 11 possible cases out of 36
to get at least one six.

Here's a program to check my computation:
\input{stdout/stdout08c.tex}
