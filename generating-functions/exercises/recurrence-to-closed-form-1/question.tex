Let $a_n$ be defined by the following recurrence relation:
\[
a_n =
\begin{cases}
3 &\text{ if } n = 0 \\
5 &\text{ if } n = 1 \\
a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} &\text{ if } n > 1
\end{cases}
\]
Compute $a_2, a_3, a_4$ by hand from the recurrence relation.
Derive a closed form for $a_n$ and verify 
$a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_4$ fit your closed form.
