What if the original tower of Hanoi problem is now changed so
that you have 4 pegs?
This is called Reve's puzzle. There's a Frank-Stewart algorithm since 1941,
but it is not known if this algorithm is optimal.
This is a good research project.
You should of course find an algorithm that runs faster that $2^n - 1$.
What about 5 pegs? Etc.
