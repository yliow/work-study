Analyze this problem:
Find a closed form for $a_n$ where
\[
a_n = \frac{p(n)}{q(n)} a_{n - 1} + r(n)
\]
where $p(n), q(n), r(n)$ are polynomials (in $n$).
The method used in the first problem of this section relies
heavily on your ability (luck?) of integrating complex looking functions.
The smart (and deep) question is to ask what functions can be integrated?
What functions cannot be integrated? In fact what do you mean by
\lq\lq can be integrated''?
Do some research on this and write a paper.
