  \[
  b_n = 4b_{n-1} - 4b_{n-2}
  \]
  \begin{enumerate}[nosep,label=(\alph*)]
  \item What is the characteristic equation?
  \item What are the roots of the characteristic equation?
  \item What is the general closed form for $a_n$?
  \item If $b_0 = 1, b_1 = 1$, what is the closed form for $b_n$?
  \end{enumerate}
