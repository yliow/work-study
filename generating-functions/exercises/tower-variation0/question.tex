Here's a variation of the original Tower of Hanoi problem. 
The new rule is this: 
No disk can be moved from $A$ to $C$.
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item[(a)]
To familiarize yourself with this problem, compute $a_1, a_2, a_3$.
\item[(b)]
Design a recursive procedure and compute the 
recurrence relation on the number of moves in this case.
\item[(c)] If the recurrence relation on the runtime is easy (fingers
crossed), attempt to find a closed form.
\end{enumerate}
