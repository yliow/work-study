  This is an aside:
  Write a program to extract the $n$-th coefficient from the power series
  of a function. 
  For instance suppose a function \texttt{f(x)} is already
  written in a programming language.
  How would you write a function to extract the coefficient of $x^{100}$ in 
  the power series of $f$?
  [Hint: Let $f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \cdots$. Then we get $a_0$ very easily:
  $a_0 = f(0)$. But what about the rest?
  $f(x) - a_0 = a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots$.
  How would you approximate $a_1$? Well from the above you get this:
  \[
    \frac{f(x) - a_0}{x} = a_1 + a_2x^1 + a_3x^2 + \cdots
  \]
  Now what?
  What about $a_2$? $a_3$? etc.
  If you have taken calc, does this remind you of something?
  Maclaurin series? Taylor series?]
