  The above is an exponentiation computation on
  a complex number.
  The above computation uses binomial theorem.
  Later you'll learn the 
  de Moivre's theorem, a very powerful tool for exponentiation.
  After you learn de Moivre's theorem, come back to this problem
  and compute
  $\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i \right)^3$
  using de Moivre's theorem.
