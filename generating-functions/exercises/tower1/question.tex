  The above proves that the recursive procedure I used
  will take up $2^n - 1$ moves.
  But how do you know that the procedure is the \textit{best}
  strategy?
  Is there another strategy that moves with fewer steps?
  Our strategy is in fact the best as in it uses the least
  number of moves, so prove that our strategy is optimal.
