How many ways are there to choose $a$ and $b$ such that
\[
a + b = 6
\]
such that $a \geq 0$ is an integer, and
$b \geq 0$ is an even integer.
Compute this number in two different ways:
one by listing all possible $(a, b)$ and another way by 
computing the coefficient of $x^6$ of the product
of two polynomials.
Now change 6 to any positive integer $n$ and solve the
problem in general.
