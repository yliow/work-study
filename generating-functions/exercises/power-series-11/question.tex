Some simple drills for you.
Answer the following using Proposition \ref{prop:product-of-power-series}
(on p \pageref{prop:product-of-power-series}).
\begin{enumerate}[nosep,label=(\alph*)]
\item 
What is the coefficient of $x^3$ of
\[
\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} x^n \cdot \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} x^n
\]
What about the coefficient $x^n$? Simplify it (write it in closed form) and
write the above product as a power series.
\item Do the same for 
\[
\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} x^n \cdot \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{3^n} x^n
\]
\item Is it possible to compute the coefficient of $x^3$ of
\[
(1 + 5x - 3x^2 + 2x^3 + 3x^4 + \cdots) \cdot (1 - 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 - 3x^4 + \cdots) 
\]
if I only give you the first 5 terms of each power series? (The rest were lost in transmission.)
Which coefficients can you determine correctly?
\end{enumerate}
