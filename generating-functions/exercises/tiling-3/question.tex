Let's go back to the original tiling problem: 
you are given a 2-by-$n$ area
\begin{python}
from latextool_basic import *
plot = Plot()
plot += Rect(0, 0, 5, 2)
print(plot)
\end{python}
and you need to tile it with 2-by-1 tiles that look like this:
\begin{python}
from latextool_basic import *
plot = Plot()
plot += Rect(0, 0, 1, 2, background='blue!20!white')
print(plot)
\end{python}
What if I say to you that I only want to consider the
case where the tiling does not have two consecutive verticals in the tiling?
What is the recurrence relation?
