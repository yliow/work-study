  Let $n \geq 3$ and let $t_n$ be the number of ways to triangulate a convex
  polygon
  with $n$ vertices.
  A convex polygon is a polygon where if you draw a line between any two
  vertices of the polygon, this line is in the polygon (and not outside).
  Here's a triangulation for the case of $n = 6$:

  (Triangulation is a very important step in geometric computations
  and appears in areas
  such as computer graphics, computer vision, geographic information
  systems, etc.)
