Let $b_n$ be defined by the following recurrence relation:
\[
b_n =
\begin{cases}
3 &\text{ if } n = 0 \\
5 &\text{ if } n = 1 \\
7b_{n-1} + 11b_{n-2} &\text{ if } n > 1
\end{cases}
\]
Derive a closed form for $b_n$.
Again make sure that you check your closed form is
correct for several cases of $b_n$ computed by hand.
