Here are two variations of the tower of Hanoi.
Suppose that instead of $n$ disks, you have $2n$ disks
of $n$ different sizes, i.e. 
there are exactly two disks with the same size.
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item Assume two disks of the same sizes are indistinguishable.
\item$^*$ Assume two disks of the same sizes are distinguishable
and their relative position is retained when all disks are moved to the
target peg.
\end{enumerate}
