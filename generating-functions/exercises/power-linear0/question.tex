  Let $A = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \}$ and $B = \{ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$.
  \begin{enumerate}[nosep,label=(\alph*)]
  \item
    How many possible ways are there to choose $a$ from $A$ and $b$ from $B$
    such that
    \[
    a + b = 8
    \]
    (List all the possible $(a,b)$'s.)
    Compute the coefficient of $x^8$ in the product
    \[
    (x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5+x^6+x^7)(x+x^3+x^5+x^9)
    \]
  \item
    What is the number of ways to choose $a$ from $A$ and $b$ from $B$
    such that 
    \[
    a + b = 5
    \]
    What is the coefficient of $x^5$ in the above product of polynomials?
  \end{enumerate}
