  let $C_n$ be the number of ways to fully parenthesize a product of
  $n + 1$ symbols.
  For instance when $n = 4$,
  here's one way to parenthesize $x_0 x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4$:
  \[
    x_0 ((x_1 (x_2 x_3)) x_4)
  \]
  The fully parenthesized expression will then allow you to compute
  the product.
  ($C_n$ will then tell you how many possible ways to compute the
  product, which will tell you how many cases you would need to analyze
  before actually caring out the multiplications.
  This is important for instance in matrix chain multiplications
  where different parenthesizing gives rise to very different runtimes.
  See CISS358.)
