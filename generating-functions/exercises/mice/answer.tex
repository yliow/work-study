Let $G_n = (A, B, C)$ where $n$ is the number of months (since the
beginning), $A$ is the number of pairs with age 0,
$B$ is the number of pairs with age 1,
$C$ is the number of pairs with age $\geq 2$.
Then
\[
G_{n+1} = (2(B + C), A, B + C)
\]
and
\[
G_{n+2} = (2(A + B + C), 2(B + C), A + B + C)
\]
Altogether we have
\begin{align*}
  G_n &= (A, B, C) \\
  G_{n+1} &= (2(B + C), A, B + C) \\
  G_{n+2} &= (2(A + B + C), 2(B + C), A + B + C)
\end{align*}
For $G_n = (A, B, C)$, let $F_n = A + B + C$.
Suppose $F_{n + 2} = aF_{n+1} + b F_n$. 
Then
\[
(2(A + B + C) + 2(B + C) + (A + B + C)
= a ((2(B + C) + A + B + C)) + b (A + B + C)
\]
i.e.,
\[
3A + 5B + 5C
= (a + b)A + (3a + b)B + (3a + b)C
\]
Hence $a = 1, b = 2$.
Hence
\[
F_{n + 2} = F_{n+1} + 2F_n
\]
We also have $F_0 = 1 = F_1$.
Altogether we have
\[
F_n =
\begin{cases}
  1 & \text{ if } n = 0, 1 \\
  F_{n - 1} + 2F_{n - 2} & \text{ if } n \geq 3
\end{cases}
\]
Hence
 \begin{align*}
   F_0 &= 1 \\
   F_1 &= 1 \\
   F_2 &= 3 \\
   F_3 &= 5 \\
   F_4 &= 11 \\
   F_5 &= 21 \\
   F_6 &= 43 \\
   F_7 &= 85 \\
      F_8 &= 171 \\
   F_9 &= 341 \\
   F_{10} &= 683 \\
   F_{11} &= 1365 \\
   F_{12} &= 2731
 \end{align*}
(One can draw a diagram similar to the original Fibonacci problem
and verify the first few numbers are indeed correct.)
