How many ways are there to choose $a$ and $b$ such that
\[
a + b + c + d = 6
\]
such that $a \geq 2$ is an integer,
$b \geq 0$ is an odd integer,
and both $c \geq 0$ and $d \geq 0$ are integers. 
Again compute this number in two different ways:
one by listing all possible $(a, b)$ and another way by 
computing the coefficient of $x^6$ of the product
of two polynomials.
Now change 6 to any positive integer $n$ and solve the
problem in general.
