Write down the generating function for the partition of $n$ where
every number in a partition can appear at most 3 times.
For instance in the partitions of $6$,
\[
2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \\
\]
is not allowed since 1 appears 4 times.
For instance the even partitions of 6 are
\begin{align*}
6
&= 6 \\
&= 5 + 1\\
&= 4 + 2 \\
&= 4 + 1 + 1 \\
&= 3 + 3 \\
&= 3 + 2 + 1 \\
&= 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 \\
&= 2 + 2 + 2 \\
&= 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 \\
\end{align*}
Note that there are 9 such partitions.
Verify that the coefficient of $x^6$ in your generating function is 9.
