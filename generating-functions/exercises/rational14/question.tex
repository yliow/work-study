  \begin{enumerate}[nosep,label=(\alph*)]
    \item Prove Pascal's triangle algebraically:
      \[
        \binom{n}{r} = \binom{n-1}{n-r} + \binom{n-1}{r}
      \]
    \item Prove Pascal's triangle using a combinatorial argument.
    \item Prove the binomial theorem by induction.
    \item Prove that if $x,y\in \R$, then
      \[
        (x + y)^N = \sum_{n=0}^{N} \binom{N}{n} x^n y^{N-n}
      \]
      This is also called the \defone{binomial theorem}.
      (To be proper, historically, this version is called the binomial theorem,
      but both versions of binomial are equivalent to each other.
      The reason this is called the \lq\lq binomial" theorem is because
      this allows you to expand powers of $x + y$ and $x - y$, \lq\lq polynomials
      in two variables".)
    \item Prove that
      \[
        \sum_{n=0}^{N} \binom{N}{n} = 2^N
      \]
      using the binomial theorem and then by using a combinatorial argument.
    \item Prove that
      \[
        \sum_{n=0}^{N} \binom{N}{n}(-1)^n = 0
      \]
  \end{enumerate}
