Write down the generating function for the partition of $n$ where
only even numbers are allowed.
For instance the even partitions of 6 are
\begin{align*}
6
&= 6 \\
&= 4 + 2 \\
&= 2 + 2 + 2 
\end{align*}
Note that there are 3 such partitions.
Verify that the coefficient of $x^6$ in your generating function is 3.
