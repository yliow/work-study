Welcome to your first day of work at Fullabugz Company.
Your job is to write MIPS
code, debug MIPS code (written by someone else ... ARGHHH), etc.

%\input{handwritten}

Do not give me two answers for the same question.
I reserve the right to choose one
for you ...  and I always choose the wrong one (if there is one)!

Here's some useful info:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item Print int: syscall 1
\item Read int: syscall 5
\item Print string: syscall 4
\item Read string: syscall 8
\item Exit: syscall 10
\end{enumerate}
You should know what to do with \verb!$v0!, \verb!$a0!, \verb!$a1!, right?
