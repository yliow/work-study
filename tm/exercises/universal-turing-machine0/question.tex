  Construct a TM such that when given a string of the form
  \[
  \# x_1 \# x_2 \# x_3 \# x_4 \# \cdots \# x_n \#\# y
  \]
  with $x_i, y \in \{0, 1\}^*$, it will find the first $x_i$
  that is equal to $y$ and mark it by changing the \# in front of
  $x_i$ from \# to @ and then accepts.
  If no such $x_i$ is found, the machine rejects the input.
  For instance when given this:
  \[
  \# 0010 \# 11000 \# 10101010 \# 11100  \#\# 10101010
  \]
  The machine accepts with this on the tape:
  \[
  \$\# 0010 \# 11000 @ 10101010 \# 11100  \#\# 10101010
  \]
  If you can do the above, then you believe that the part
  of $U$ that finds the relevant transition rule is doable.
