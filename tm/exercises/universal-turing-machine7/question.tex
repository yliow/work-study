  Design a universal TM $U''$ that simulates two machines,
  running the pair in a fair manner, i.e., run one transition
  on one of the TM and then run one transition on the other
  and then repeat.
  If any of the two accepts, $U'$ accepts.
  If both rejects, $U'$ rejects.  
  %If anyone of the two halts, just continuing simulating the remaining.
  %Of course if both halts, $U''$ halts too.
