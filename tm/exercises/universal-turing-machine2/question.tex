  Construct a TM that such given a string of the form
  \[
  \# c \# x @y00 z 
  \]
  where $c$ is 1 or 11 or 111, $x,z in \{1\}^*$, and $y \in \{0, 1\}^*$
  that does not contain 00,
  then if $c = 1$, the string $@y00$ will move to the left by 1,
  if $c = 11$, the string $@y00$ will move to the right by 1,
  and if $c = 111$, the input does not change.
  For instance if the input is
  \[
  \# 1 \# 11111 @11100 11111 
  \]
  then the TM will change the input to this:
  \[
  \# 1 \# 1111 @11100 111111 
  \]
  and accept.
  If the input is
  \[
  \# 11 \# 11111 @11100 11111 
  \]
  then the TM will change the input to this:
  \[
  \# 11 \# 111111 @11100 1111 
  \]
  and accept.
  You get the idea.
  If the input is not of the form above, the TM rejects.
  
  If you can do the above, then you will believe that it's possible
  to move the encoding of the state in the encoding of the ID
  to the left or to the right or make it stay.
