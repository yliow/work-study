  Design a universal TM $U'''$ that simulates a TM $M$ running on $w$
  and keeps a history of its computation, i.e., it record of all the IDs.
  If $U'''$ sees a two completed IDs which are the same,
  $U'''$ halts in the reject state.
  Otherwise it halts in the same halt state of $M$ running on $w$.
