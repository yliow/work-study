Let $M$ be a DTM with no $\DOLLAR$ provided automatically as
beginning-of-tape marker.
Construct a new DTM from $M$, say $M'$,
so that at the beginning (that means at the start state),
the $M'$ \lq\lq shifts'' the input to the right by one square,
inserts $\DOLLAR$ as the first character, this new $M'$ has
the transition
\[
\delta(q, \DOLLAR) = (q, \DOLLAR, R)
\]
for all $q \in Q$
and otherwise $M'$ \lq\lq work the same as'' $M$.
