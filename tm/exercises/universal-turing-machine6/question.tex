  A TM can potentially run forever.
  Describe a universal TM $U'$
  that allows you to specify how long to
  simulate $M$ on input $w$.
  Note that this $U'$ will always halt:
  if $M$ accepts/rejects $w$ in $n$ steps, then $U'$ halts in the
  accept/reject state.
  If $M$ does not enter its accept/reject state in $n$ steps,
  then $U'$ enters its reject state and halt.
  [HINT: For the input, you need the encoding of the
  TM, encoding of the input, and encoding of \lq\lq time''.]
