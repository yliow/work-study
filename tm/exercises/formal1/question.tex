  Implementation note:
  Of course instead of using
\[
 w q w'
\]
to describe an instantaneous description
(where $w,w'$ are words and $q$ is a state),
one can also use
\[
 (w, q, w')
\]
In terms of implementation, this is clearly better.
Otherwise in your program, you would have to continually search for
the state within $wqw'$ ... which is annoying.
