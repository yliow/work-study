If we allow our $\Sigma$ to have more characters, we can
use a different encoding.
For instance, say $\Sigma = \{0,1,\#\}$.
Then we can use $\#$ as a \lq\lq separator''.
For instance to encode $5+7$, I can use
\[
1^5 \# 1 \# 1^7
\]
This frees up $0$.
Therefore I can use binary number representation.
For instance $5$ now can be encoded as $101$ (i.e., $101_2$).
In that case $5 + 7$ becomes
\[
\langle 5 \rangle \# \langle + \rangle \# \langle 7 \rangle
= 101 \# 1 \# 111
\]
Using this encoding to design a TM that computes $\Z$.
