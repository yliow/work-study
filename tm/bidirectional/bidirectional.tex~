\section{Bidirectional Tape TM}

Instead of a TM with the infinite tape going one way, what if we
consider a TM with a bidirectional tape? In other words the tape
goes infinitely to the left and right and before you run the
machine, the input is placed in the middle and the read/write head
starts at the first character of the string. In this TM more
powerful? No. For instance while running this new machine, suppose
the tape looks like:
\[
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  $\ldots$ & e & b & a & c & d & $\ldots$ \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\]
where $a$ is the exact middle of the infinite tape, i.e., that the
first character read by the read/write head. Then you can a a
similar 2-tape TM where the tape corresponding to the above looks
like:
\[
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  a & c & d & $\ldots$ \\
    & b & e & \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\]
Now you can simulate this 2--tape TM with a 1--tape TM.
