\section{Languages which are not Turing Recognizable}

After so much work to build more and more powerful machines from DFA to PDA and then to Turing machines,
it's a let down that there are still languages that we cannot compute.
For a fixed $\Sigma$ say $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$, there are still languages
not accepted by a Turing machine.

I'll show you why.

The first proof does not really construct a language which is not 
Turing recognizable.
We're also not using any kind of \lq\lq pumping lemma for Turing machines''.
Instead I am going to \lq\lq count'' the number of Turing machines
and the number of languages and then show you that there are more languages
than Turing machines.

Before we do that, I will need to expand your mind a little ... you 
see there are infinitely many Turing machines and infinitely many
languages!
We have to \lq\lq count'' in the world of infinities and I have to say
(in a sense) that the infinity of the Turing machines is smaller than
the infinity of languages.

So we have to go back to the days when you first were born ...
and to count all over again ...
