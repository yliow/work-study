\sectionthree{Bidirectional Tape TM}
\begin{python0}
from solutions import *; clear()

Instead of a TM with the infinite tape going one way, what if we
consider a TM with a bidirectional tape? In other words the tape
goes infinitely to the left \textit{and infinitely to the right}
and before you run the
machine, the input is placed in the \lq\lq middle'' and the read/write head
starts at the first character of the string. Is this TM more
powerful? No! Because it can be simulated with a 2-tape TM which you know
can be simulated with the usual TM.
