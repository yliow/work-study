  Using an array, 
  build a maxheap by inserting the following into an empty tree:
  1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 4, 2, 0, 8, 9.
  Make sure the tree is complete after each insert and the leaves
  at the lowest level are all on the left.
  Call the array \texttt{x}
  (assume it has size at least 10)
  and use integer variable \texttt{len}
  for the length of \texttt{x}.
  Of course initially \texttt{len} is 0.
