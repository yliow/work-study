\section{Priority queues}

Recall a queue is a data structure that supports
enqueue and dequeue.
Think of people lining up at a ticket booth.
A \defterm{priority queue} is queue where people join a queue \textit{but}
they have priority numbers.
Say, a higher number means higher priority.
Obviously, you can implement such a priority queue
using a maxheap.
The runtimes are then as follows:
\begin{tightlist}
  \item enqueue: $O(\log n)$
  \item dequeue: $O(\log n)$
\end{tightlist}


In this case, both inserts and deletes have runtime of $O(\log n)$.
This is obviously better than say using a deque where you have to 
move a node forward one-step-at-a-time in the deque based on the priority.
If you use a deque to implement
a priority queue, then in the worse case, where value enters the
priority queue with highest priority, this value will enter the
end of the deque and move one step at a time all the way to the front.
So using a deque to implement a priority would mean that you have a
worse runtime of $O(n)$!


Sometimes, one needs to change the priority of a job.
Here's an example ...

Linux allows user to display running processes using the
\verb!ps! command:
priority of processes.
The following is a list of processes that I'm running:
{\scriptsize
\begin{console}
[student@localhost n]$ ps -l
F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD
0 S  1000  3148 26588  0  80   0 -  8250 poll_s pts/0    00:07:46 xemacs
0 R  1000  7239 26588  0  80   0 -  1253 -      pts/0    00:00:00 ps
0 S  1000 26588 20828  0  80   0 -  1574 wait   pts/0    00:00:01 bash
0 S  1000 28473     1  1  80   0 - 75939 poll_s pts/0    00:00:34 atril
\end{console}
}
The priority is under the column labeled \texttt{NI}.
Notice that \texttt{xemacs} is running with priority \texttt{0}.
I can change the priority of my \texttt{xemacs} to this:
{\scriptsize
\begin{console}
F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD
0 S  1000  3148 26588  0  81   1 -  8250 poll_s pts/0    00:07:47 xemacs
0 R  1000  8093 26588  0  80   0 -  1253 -      pts/0    00:00:00 ps
0 S  1000 26588 20828  0  80   0 -  1574 wait   pts/0    00:00:01 bash
0 S  1000 28473     1  1  80   0 - 76240 poll_s pts/0    00:00:35 atril
\end{console}
}
In Linux a higher priority means lower priority number.
So a min heap is more relevant.
But I'll stick to max heap since if you understood max heap, then
min heap is easy.
