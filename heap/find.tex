\section{Find}

Note that a heap is not a BST.
There's no fast way of finding a value in the heap.

One way to find a particular value in the heap 
is 
to map a search key to the index of the value in 
the heap.
For instance suppose your heap contains 
$(\text{priority}, \text{object-search-key})$
then you might want to have an array
\verb!x! so that 
if 
$(\text{5}, \text{123238})$
is at index 42 in your heap
where the priority is 5 for some process id 123238
then 
\verb!x[123238]! = 42.
This \verb!x! can also be a hashtable.
Or \verb!x! can be replaced by a BST.
My preference is a hashtable.

Note that the above implies that 
the heap insert must return an index value
so that the index value for the node added to the 
heap can be recorded in the hashtable.

Of course during heapify-up or heapify-down or some other
heap operations, you also need to update
this \verb!x!.
This will not affect the runtime of the heap operations
if the expected time taking to manage
\verb!x! for various swaps is $O(1)$.
