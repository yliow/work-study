Here's the PDA state diagram again:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,node distance=2cm,auto,initial text=]
\node[state] (q1) at (3.5,0.0) {$q_1$};
\node[state,initial,accepting] (q0) at (0.0,0.0) {$q_0$};
\node[state,accepting] (q3) at (0.0,-3) {$q_3$};
\node[state] (q2) at (3.5,-3) {$q_2$};

\path[->]
(q0) edge [bend left=0,pos=0.5,above] node {$(\ep,\ep\rightarrow\$)$} (q1)
(q1) edge [loop right] node {$(a,\ep\rightarrow a)$} ()
(q1) edge [] node {$(\ep,\ep\rightarrow\ep)$} (q2)
(q2) edge [bend left=0,pos=0.5,below] node {$(\ep, \$\rightarrow\ep)$} (q3)
(q2) edge [loop right] node {$(b,a\rightarrow \ep)$} ()
;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{tightlist}
\item There are two possible executions that will accept the string $\ep$.
What are the list of states visited by these two executions?
\item Is $a$ accepted by the PDA? Describe all possible executions.
\item Is $b$ accepted by the PDA? Describe all possible executions.
\item Is $ab$ accepted by the PDA? Describe all possible executions.
\item Is $ba$ accepted by the PDA? Describe all possible executions.
\item Is $aab$ accepted by the PDA? Describe all possible executions.
\item Is $abb$ accepted by the PDA? Describe all possible executions.
\item Is $aabb$ accepted by the PDA? Describe all possible executions.
\item Is $bbaa$ accepted by the PDA? Describe all possible executions.
\item Now can you tell me the language accepted by this PDA?
\item What if I make the first state a non--accepting state? What is the 
resulting language?
\end{tightlist}
