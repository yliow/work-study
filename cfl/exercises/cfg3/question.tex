\begin{tightlist}
\item Write down a CFG $G_1$ such that $L(G_1) = \{ \epsilon \}$.
\item Write down a CFG $G_2$ such that $L(G_2) = \{a\}$.
\item Let $x$ be a string in $\Sigma^*$
where $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$.
Write down a CFG $G$ such that $L(G_3) = \{x\}$.
(Of course this would include the previous two problems.)
