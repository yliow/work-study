Here's a grammar
\[
G : S \rightarrow aS \,|\, \epsilon
\]
where $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$.
Which of the following strings are generated by $G$?
For the strings generated by $G$, write down a derivation.
\begin{tightlist}
\item $\ep$
\item $a$
\item $b$
\item $aa$
\item $ab$
\item $ba$
\item $bb$
\end{tightlist}
What is $L(G)$?
