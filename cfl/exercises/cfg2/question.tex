Let $G$ be the following context free grammar:
\begin{align*}
  S &\rightarrow aS & \tag{1} \\
  S &\rightarrow T  & \tag{2} \\
  T &\rightarrow Tb & \tag{3} \\
  T &\rightarrow \ep & \tag{4} \\
\end{align*}
where $S$ is the starting variable.
Which of the following strings are generated by $G$?
For each string that is generated by $G$, write down a derivation for
that string citing the rule used for each step.
\begin{tightlist}
\item $\ep$
\item $a$
\item $b$
\item $aa$
\item $ab$
\item $ba$
\item $bb$
\item $aabb$
\item $abab$
\item $bbaa$
\end{tightlist}
Write down in set notation the language generated by $G$, i.e., $L(G)$.
Can you rewrite the above without variable $T$?
