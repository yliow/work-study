Of course with the above information, you can now
write a simple program to check if a string is generated by a CFG (you
would need the grammar to be in Chomsky Normal Form).
By the way, you can also store the production rule in each cell if you
want your program to list the production rule for each derivation
step. Another thing is that you need to search the list of production 
rules to fill up the table.
You want to think about how you want to represent the list of
production rules and how they should be
organized in a container to allow fast searches relevant to
completing the CYK table.
Also, note that in our algorithm above, when we compute
the variables $V$ in a cell, we include the information
\[
  V_{(i,j)(k,l), ...}
\]
to indicate that $V$ can derive $XY$ where $X$ is in the
set of variables in cell $(i,j)$ and $Y$ is in the set of variables
in cell $(k,l)$.
You might want to include more information about $X$ and $Y$.
For instance you might want to
do
\[
  V_{(i,j,m)(k,l,n), ...}
\]
to include the fact that the $X$ is the $m$--th variable at cell $(i,j)$
(if you're using an array for each cell)
and $Y$ is the $n$--th variable at cell $(k,l)$.
