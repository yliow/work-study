Consider the following CFG:
\[
G: 
\begin{cases}
S &\rightarrow Ta^3T \\
T &\rightarrow a \,|\, b \,|\, \epsilon 
\end{cases}
\]
(If the start variable is not specified and there's an $S$ in the grammar, 
then $S$ is the start variable.)
\begin{tightlist}
\item What is the shortest string that can be derived from $G$?
(The length should be 3.)
\item Derive strings of length 4 from $G$.
\item Derive strings of length 5 from $G$.
\item OK ... so here's the real question ... what is the language
generated by this grammar?
\item Now modify the grammar so that the language is
$\{xa^3y \,|\, x, y \in \Sigma^*\}$ where $\Sigma^* = \{a, b\}$.
\end{tightlist}
