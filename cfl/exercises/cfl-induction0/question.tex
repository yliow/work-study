Why did I prove 
\[
\text{
\lq\lq If $S \implies^{\hspace{-0,2cm} *}\ x_1S x_2$ then $x_1 = a^n$ and $x_2 = b^n$'' 
}
\]
instead of 
\[
\text{
\lq\lq If $S \implies^{\hspace{-0.3cm} *}\ x$ then $x = a^nb^n$''
}
\] 
directly? 
(Hint: Try to prove the second version by induction yourself
and see what happens.)
