  Let $\{\SUCCESS, \FAILURE\}$ where $\SUCCESS \mapsto p$ be the pdf of a Bernoulli trial.
  Consider the random experiment of performing a sequence of Bernoulli trial
  until you arrive at a success.
  Let
  \[
  S = \{(\SUCCESS), (\FAILURE, \SUCCESS), (\FAILURE, \FAILURE, \SUCCESS), ...\}
  \]
  be the sample space of this experiment.
  Define $p((x_0, x_1, ..., x_{n-1})) = q^{n-1}p$.
  Show that $p(S) = 1$.
