John Cantcode is a pretty bad programmer. 
At Fullabugz, it is known that the chance of him writing a buggy
\cpp\ program is 3 times that of his Python program.
(Fullabugz uses only two languages. Why?
More than two means more headaches for John's manager.)
One third of the programs at Fullabugz is \cpp\ programs
and according to statistics the percentage of \cpp\ programs that
crashed in the past 10 years at the company is 80\%.
John writes 1/4 of all the programs at Fullabuz.
His manager just ran a program and it crashed.
What is the probability that this was a \cpp\ program?
What is the probability that this program was written by John?
(Do this empirically, i.e., do some simulations.)
Is there enough information to compute the probability?
If not, what is lacking?
