Suppose again you want to roll a die until you get all the possible faces.
Now note that to get your first number, you need only one roll.
Suppose you get a $\FOUR$.
For your second roll, you might    get a different number with one roll, but you might not.
But suppose (because I'm nice), I let you have two tries to get a different number.
Suppose on your first roll to get a number different from $\FOUR$, you get $\TWO$
in just one roll -- lucky you.
For your third number (different from $\FOUR$ and $\TWO$), I give you three tries.
Suppose you rolled three times and you got $\FOUR$, $\TWO$, $\TWO$ -- you can't
get a different number in three tries.
Too bad.
In that case you have to start all over again, i.e., your $\FOUR$ and $\TWO$ does not count anymore.
How many rolls do you need to get all the six different faces?
What if you have an $n$--sided fair die?
