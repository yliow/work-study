  Consider the random experiment of rolling two dice.
  The sample space is $S = S_1 \times S_2$ where
  $S_i = \{\ONE, \TWO, \ldots, \SIX \}$ ($i = 0, 1$).
  For instance $(\ONE, \TWO) \in S$ is the outcome that the first
  die is $\ONE$ and the second die is $\TWO$.
  The probability is uniform.
  Let $X_1((s_1, s_2)) = s_1$ and $X_2((s_1, s_2)) = s_2$.
  Compute the following:
  \begin{myenum}
    \li Are the events $X_1 = \ONE$ and $X_1 \in \{\ONE, \TWO\}$ independent?
    \lq\lq $X_1 = \ONE$" is the event that the first die roll is one.
    \lq\lq $X_1 \in \{\ONE, \TWO\}$" is the event that the first die roll is either one or two.
    \li Are the events $X_1 = \ONE$ and $X_2 \in \{\ONE, \TWO\}$ independent?
  \end{myenum}
