  What is the average number of \lq\lq shuffles" you need in order
  to \lq\lq fully randomize" a desk of cards?
  Make sure you define your \lq\lq shuffle" operation and what you
  mean by a \lq\lq random" deck of cards.
  For instance a simple shuffle is to cut the deck:
  Assuming the deck is $[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]$, you pick a random number such as $6$,
  you cut the deck to get $[0,1,2,3,4,5]$ and $[6,7,8,9]$
  and then get $[6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5]$.
