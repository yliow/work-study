The tetris game has 5 shapes: 
SQUARE, l, Z, S, T.
To make your tetrix game annoying, you have decided to make Z
5 times more likely to appear than S, S 5 times more likely than T,
T 5 times more like than l, and l 5 times more likely than SQUARE.
(And you make the shapes fall down real fast too.)
Write down the probabilities of the shapes. 
You gave your game to Dr. Liow who (promptly) dies after
playing the game for 20 seconds.
If a total of 100 shapes appear, approximately how many of each shape
appear.
