What if your static array is always sorted?

\subsection{Insert}

If you have to insert a value at an index position $i$,
the runtime is still the same as the case of a static unsorted array.
(Think about it. Remember the array must be sorted.
Technically, since the array is sorted, you don't provide an
index. We say that container is \defone{self-organizing}.
But you can also allow the user to specify an index,
with the caveat that the user knows what he/she is doing.)

\subsection{Delete}

If you have to delete a value at an index position $i$,
the runtime is still the same as the case of a static unsorted array.
(Right?)

\subsection{Search}

In this case, since the array is sorted, instead of scanning the
array left-to-right, you would use binary search.
The worse runtime (in fact also the average) is
\[
O(\lg n)
\]
Of course if the value you're looking for is exactly in the middle of the
array (in the sense that the first probe of binary search hits that value),
then the runtime is
\[
O(1)
\]
\begin{longtable}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
Sorted array & Best   & Average      & Worse  \\* 
\hline\hline
Insert       & $O(1)$ & $O(n)$       & $O(n)$ \\*
Delete       & $O(1)$ & $O(n)$       & $O(n)$ \\*
Search       & $O(1)$ & $O(\lg n)$ & $O(\lg n)$ \\* 
\hline
\end{longtable}
