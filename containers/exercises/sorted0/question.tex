Write a template \verb!SortedArray! class with the following 
methods:
\begin{console}[fontsize=\footnotesize]
void insert(T key);
void delete(T key);
int  search(T key); // returns index or -1 (if not found)
T    operator[](int index) const;
T &  operator[](int index);
\end{console}
Do not allow duplicate values in the \verb!SortedArray! object.
During an \verb!insert!, if the value to be inserted is already in the 
object, throw a \verb!DuplicateValue! exception object.
Set the maximum capacity of your \verb!Array! objects to 1000000.
Collect timing data for the following scenarios for 
\verb!SortedArray< int >! objects:
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the time taken to insert a value when
$n = 100000$, $200000$, $300000$, $400000$, ..., $1000000$?
\item What is the time taken to delete the value at a given index position
when
$n = 100000$, $200000$, $300000$, $400000$, ..., $1000000$?
\item What is the time taken to search for a value when
$n = 100000$, $200000$, $300000$, $400000$, ..., $1000000$?
\item What is the time taken to access a value at an index position when
$n = 100000$, $200000$, $300000$, $400000$, ..., $1000000$?
\end{itemize}
Make a plot.
For your experiments, make sure your array contains distinct values.
