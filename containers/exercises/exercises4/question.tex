  Write a function \verb!merge(u, v)! that accepts two
  sorted vectors and return a sorted vector from the values in
  \verb!u! and \verb!v!.
  Use the obvious algorithm that runs in $O(n)$.
  (Hint: scan both vectors at the same time and choose the smaller
  value from the two to be placed in the new vector.)
