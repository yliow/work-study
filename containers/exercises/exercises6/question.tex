  Let \verb!v! be a \verb!std::vector! of points in 2D space, i.e.,
  each value of \verb!v! is of the form \verb!(x, y)! where \verb!x! and
  \verb!y! are \verb!double!s.
  The \verb!std::pair! is used.
  You want to sort \verb!v! based on the distance from \verb!(0, 0)!.
  The distance of \verb!(x, y)! from \verb!(0, 0)! is given by the distance
  formula (or Pythagorus theorem).
  Since you will need to compute the distance of \verb!(x, y)! from the
  origin several times, you have decided to do this:
  you create a new \verb!std::vector!, called \verb!v1!, of \verb!(x, y, d)!
  where \verb!d! is the distance of \verb!(x, y)! from the origin.
  After your bubblesort, you copy the contents of \verb!v1! to \verb!v! (of course omitting the
  \verb!d! value).
  Test your program.
