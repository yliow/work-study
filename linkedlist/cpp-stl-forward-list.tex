\begin{python0}
from solutions import *; clear()
\end{python0}

\cpp\ STL started out with only doubly linked list.
Singly linked list was added later.
The \cpp\ STL singly linked class is \verb!std::forward_list!.

Run and study the following very carefully:
\VerbatimInput[frame=single,fontsize=\footnotesize]{forward_list/main.cpp}
Here's the output:
\input{stdout30.tex}

The methods are somewhat similiar to \cpp\
STL doubly linked list; see next
section.

\begin{ex}
  Check out the copy constructor, \verb!operator=!, and \verb!operator==!.
\end{ex}
