\section{Applications}

There are many applications of linked lists (singly or doubly linked), stacks, and
queues.
(Don't forget that stacks and queues use lists so that when you use stacks/queues
you're really using linked lists too.)

I'm just going to talk about just a couple of them.

The first few will be on evaluating mathematical expressions, something that you
have been doing since elementary school.
Besides the standard mathematical expressions such as
\[
\text{\texttt{1 + 2 - 3 * 5}} 
\]
we will also look at expressions using a different mathemaical language where a
sentence in this language looks like this:
\[
\texttt{+ 3 5}
\]
The operator is placed \textit{in front}.
Then there's this mathematical language where the operator is placed at the back,
like this:
\[
\texttt{3 5 +}
\]
Next, we'll look at some search problems.

But first let's start with several very simple
examples ...
