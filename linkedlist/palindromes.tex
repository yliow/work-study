A string is a palindrome is it is its own reverse.
For instance here's a palindrome:
\[
\text{\texttt{madam}}
\]

\begin{ex}
Write a program that prompts the user for a string
and checks if it's a palindrome.
Now what if you're only allowed to traverse strings in one direction
and you have stack?

\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
(See \url{https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/}.)
Write a program that prompts the user for an integer (not string)
and checks if it's a palindrome.
The integer \verb!5! is a palindrome.
So is
\verb!12321! and 
\verb!123321!.
However \verb!-1! is not a palindrome (its reverse is \verb!1-!).
\verb!1232! is also not a palindrome.
Do not convert the integer to a string and do not use an array.
\end{ex}
