I'm going to make some changes to the doubly linked list.
Here's a doubly linked list (without sentinel nodes):

\input{stdout41.tex}

The usual delete tail will result in this:

\input{stdout42.tex}

Write a doubly linked list class that does this instead:

\input{stdout43.tex}

When I insert 8 as tail, I don't have to allocate memory. I just use the node
with 5, but I replace the 5 with 8:

\input{stdout44.tex}

In other words, we delay the deallocation of head and tail nodes.
We can think of the used but not deallocated nodes as extra nodes
waiting to be reused.
When we do want to release the memory, we call the
\verb!shrink_to_fit()!.
Likewise, the same tbing happens at the end.

Next, add sentinel nodes:

\input{stdout45.tex}

Note that I'm renaming \texttt{phead} to 
\texttt{pheadsentinel}
and
\texttt{ptail}
to
\texttt{ptailsentinel}
(The \texttt{?} denotes integer values we don't care about.)
And if I delete the tail, the above becomes

\input{stdout46.tex}

At this point, the size of the linked list is (of course) 3
and the capacity is 4.

Of course the linked list starts off as an empty list
that looks like this (there are two sentinel nodes)

\input{stdout47.tex}

Objects of this type of linked list have
\texttt{size()} and \texttt{capacity()}
that returns the obvious integer values.
For instance for this case:

\input{stdout48.tex}

the size is 3 and the capacity is 4.

Implement this type of linked list.
