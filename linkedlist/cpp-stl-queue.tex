\sectionthree{\cpp\ STL queue: \texttt{std::queue}}
\begin{python0}
from solutions import *; clear()
\end{python0}

There's also a \verb!std::queue! class which is also a
container adaptor class like \verb!std::stack!.
The class supports
\begin{tightlist}
  \li \texttt{empty()} and \texttt{size()}
  \li \texttt{front()} and \texttt{back()}
  \li \texttt{push()} and \texttt{pop()}
\end{tightlist}
(Think of
\texttt{back} as \texttt{tail}
and
\texttt{front} as \texttt{head} of queue.)

Run and study the following very carefully:
\VerbatimInput[frame=single,fontsize=\footnotesize]{queue/main.cpp}
\begin{python}
from latextool_basic import *
print(shell('g++ main.cpp; ./a.out', dir='queue', fontsize=r'\footnotesize'))  
\end{python}
