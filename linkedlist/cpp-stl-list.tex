\begin{python0}
from solutions import *; clear()
\end{python0}

The \cpp\ STL provides a doubly-linked list class called \verb!std::list!.
The following shows you the most basic methods of this class.

Run and study the following very carefully:
\VerbatimInput[frame=single,fontsize=\footnotesize]{list/main.cpp}
Here's the output:
\input{stdout31.tex}

Of course with \verb!std::list! (since it's a doubly-linked list),
you also get a stack, a queue, and a deque.
However \cpp\ provides these classes. See next few sections.

\begin{ex}
  Recall radix sort using queues (check earlier chapter).
  Implement LSB radix sort on a vector of integers using an array of
  queues using \verb!std::queue! (that uses \verb!std::list!).
  \qed
\end{ex}
