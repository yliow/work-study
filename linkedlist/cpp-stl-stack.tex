\begin{python0}
from solutions import *; clear()
\end{python0}

The \verb!std::stack! (by default) uses \verb!std::deque! and supports
\verb!size()!, \verb!empty()!,
\verb!push_back()!,
\verb!push()!,
\verb!pop_back()!, \verb!pop()!,
\verb!back()!, \verb!top()!.
Actually \verb!std::stack! is what's called a container adaptor:
you can tell specify  type of container you want to use for the stack
implementation
whether it's \verb!std::vector!, \verb!std::list!, or \verb!std::deque!.
In fact you can specify \textit{any} class as along as
the class supports
\begin{tightlist}
  \li \texttt{empty()} and \texttt{size()}
  \li \texttt{back()}
  \li \texttt{push\_back()} and \texttt{pop\_back()}
\end{tightlist}
(Think of \texttt{back} as \texttt{top} of stack.)
