The \cpp\ STL \verb!std::deque! (double ended queue) class is a double-ended
queue but the implementation usually uses dynamic arrays, i.e.,
it's not implemented using a doubly-linked list.
Specifically, \verb!std::deque! is implemented as a
vector of pointers to
vectors of the same size.

Run and study the following very carefully:

Here's the output:
