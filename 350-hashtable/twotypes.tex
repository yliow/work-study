\sectionthree{Two types of hash tables}

There are two types of hash tables.
What I have talking about is called open address hash table.
Later I'll talk about closed address hash tables.
But to let you start writing some C++ code ASAP, 
I'm going to delay explaining closed address hash tables.
The API in the next section will apply to both open and closed
address hash tables.
