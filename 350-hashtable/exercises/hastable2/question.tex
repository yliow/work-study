Suppose you have a hash function for integer values, say $h'$.
For instance our hash function
actually can hash integer values: you simply convert the 
integer to an integer string. 
Now if you have a collision at $h(k)$, look at $h'(h(k))$.
If that's again a collision, look at $h'(h'(h(k)))$.
Etc.
Analyze this probing technique.
