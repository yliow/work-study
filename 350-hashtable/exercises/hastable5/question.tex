  In a hash table of size 8, insert the keys
  $a$,$b$,$c$,$d$,$e$,$f$,$g$
  assuming that they are hashed to
  24,12,23,45,5,13,7 respectively.
  Draw the table (leave the value column blank).
  How many rows were read altogether?
  Next delete c. How many rows were read to do this?
  Insert $h$ assuming that $h$ is has a hash value of 19.
  How many rows were
  read?
  For each key in the table,
  write down the number of rows read to find
  that key.
  Which keys can be found with the least number of
  rows read?
  Which would require the most number of rows read?
  Compute the average number of rows read for search of the keys in the table.
  Rehash the table to another table of size 11.
  Now compute the new
  average number of rows read for search of the keys in the table.
