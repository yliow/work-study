\sectionthree{Rehashing the table}
\begin{python0}
from solutions import *; clear()
\end{python0}

When there are too many collisions, then either your hash table is
too full or the hash function is bad.
Assuming your hash function is fine, then it's time to expand your
hash table.
In other words, you need to have a larger array for the hash table.
This of course implies that if you do want your hash table
to be expandable, you have to put the table on the heap, i.e.,
use a dynamic array.
Another thing is that you now cannot hardcode the size to mod within
your hash function. 

Rehashing is of course easy.
Just run through your hash table array and perform inserts into the new
table.
If you are using tombstones (see previous section), of course make
sure that you do not include them when you insert into the new table.
That's it.

Note that rehashing is (obviously) time consuming if the old table
has a large size.
