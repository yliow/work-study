\sectionthree{Hash Collision}

Recall that I want to put the following into our hash table:
\begin{longtable}{|c|c|}
\hline
Name & Height \\
\hline
Abe &  6.5 \\
Tom &  5.5 \\
Annie &  5.9 \\
\hline
\end{longtable}
Unfortunately, when I hash \verb!Annie! using our
hash function, I also get \verb!5!.
What I have here is a hash collision:
Two keys are hashed to the same integer value!!!
And \verb!Abe! is already at index \verb!5!. 

Now what?!?!
