\section{Enumerate}


\subsection{Basic enumerate}
For comparison, this is enumerate:
\begin{enumerate}
\li Line 1. 
\li line 2.
\li line 3.
\end{enumerate}
After enumerate.

This is with paragraphing within items:
\begin{enumerate}
\li Line 1. 
This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. 
This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. 

Next paragraph.
\lipsum[1]

\li line 2.
\li line 3.
\end{enumerate}

A new paragraph after mylist.




\newpage
\subsection{tightlist}

This is the same as mylist except that the vertical spacing
before and after the environment is removed.
This does not work quite right is the environment is in a paragraph of its
own -- there will be a little extra vertical spacing before the environment.

Testing tightlist:
\begin{tightlist}
\li line 1
\li line 2
\li line 3
\end{tightlist}
After environment.

This is with paragraphing within items:
\begin{tightlist}
\li Line 1. 
This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. 
This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. 

Next paragraph.
\lipsum[1]

\li line 2.
\li line 3.
\end{tightlist}

A new paragraph after above environment.
The next environment is in a new paragraph.

\begin{tightlist}
\li line 1
\li line 2
\li line 3
\end{tightlist}

\subsection{axioms}

The label horizontal spacing is larger.

\begin{axioms}
  \item[(GROUP-C)] $\forall g,g' \in G$, $gg' \in G$
  \item[(GROUP-A)] $\forall g,g',g'' \in G$, 
\end{axioms}
