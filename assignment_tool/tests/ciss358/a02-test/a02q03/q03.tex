Q3.
Consider the following statement:
Every positive integer is a sum of distinct 2-powers.
In other words, there is a set of distinct 2-powers whose sum is the 
given positive integer.
For instance the number 10 can be expressed as
\[
10 = 2^1 + 2^3
\]

(a)
Prove the above statement using strong or weak induction.

(b)
Prove the above statement using the well-ordering principle.

(Note: This is the missing piece of information in CISS360.
In CISS360, we assume that, for instance, all 32-bit unsigned int
can be written as a binary sequence which is a sum of powers of 2
up to the power of 31.
Also, the set of 2-powers adding up to $n$ is unique.
For instance $2^1 + 2^3 = 10$ and if you look at another
sum of 2--powers such as $2^1 + 2^2$, you will not get $10$.
But you don't have to prove it.)
