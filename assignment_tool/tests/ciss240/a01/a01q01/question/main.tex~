Write a C++ program that produces the following output. 
\begin{console}[numbers=left]
tic-tac-toe
by GameWorld

  0 1 2

0| | |O|0

1|X| | |1

  0 1 2

X's turn. Please enter row and column:

\end{console}
You must use only one print statement 
(i.e., there must be only one \verb!std::cout!). 
You can use as many C--strings and newline characters as you like.

For your convenience, line numbers are included in the above output..
These line numbers are not part of your program output.

Note that the \verb!O! in the tic--tac--toe board is the letter \verb!O!. 
The \verb!0! along the border is the number \verb!0!.
