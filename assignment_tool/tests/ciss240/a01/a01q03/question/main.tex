Q3. Write a program that produces the following output:
\begin{console}[numbers=left]
 d   4      3
-- 3x  = 12x
dx

\end{console}
You must use only one \verb!std::cout! in your code. 
Do not use the tab character. 

For your convenience, line numbers are included in the above output.
These line numbers are not part of your program output.
