Q5. Write a program that produces the following output:
\begin{console}[numbers=left]
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";

    return 0;
}

\end{console}
You must use only one 
\verb!std::cout! in your code. Do not use the tab character. 

For your convenience, line numbers are included in this document.
These line numbers are not part of your program output.
