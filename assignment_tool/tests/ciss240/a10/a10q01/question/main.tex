Write a simple payroll program. There are three employee types ($0$, $1$, and
$2$.) The computation of their salary is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \li Employee types $0$ and $1$ have base pay of $\$1000$ and $\$960.50$
      respectively. Employee type $2$ does not have a base pay.
  \li All employees are paid hourly wage. For employee type $0$, the hourly
      rate is $\$10.50$ per hour for regular work hours. The rate is $\$8.50$
      and $\$6.10$ for employee types $1$ and $2$ respectively. The number of
      regular hours per week is $40$.
  \li Employee type $0$ has an overtime hourly rate of $\$12.00$ per hour.
      This is the rate for work beyond $40$ hours. The overtime rate for an
      employee of type $1$ is $\$11.55$. The overtime hourly rate for a type $2$
      employee is $\$7.00$.
\end{itemize}

The program prompts the user for the employee type and the number of hours
worked. It then prints the salary earned for that employee and also the
total salary to be paid out to all employees.
When the user enters $-1$ for either the employee type
or the number of hours, the program terminates.

You MUST use constants where applicable. (There should be at least $10$.)
