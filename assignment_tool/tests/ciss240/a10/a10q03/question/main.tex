Write a simple text--based \lq\lq game\rq\rq where you control your avatar in a
2D world with $x$ coordinates between $0$ and $4$ (inclusive) and $y$
coordinates between $0$ and $4$ (inclusive). Your initial position in the 2D
world is $x = 0$, $y = 0$. You control your avatar by moving in the North, South,
East, West direction. For instance, moving it North will increase your $y$
coordinate by $1$, moving it West will decrement the $x$ coordinate by $1$.
However, you cannot move outside the 2D world, i.e., your $x$ and $y$
coordinates must be between $0$ and $4$ (inclusive). For instance, if you're at
$x = 2$, $y = 0$, moving South will not change your position; if you're at 
$x = 2$, $y = 4$, moving North will not change your position either. You enter
$0$ to move North, $1$ to move South, $2$ to move East, and $3$ to move West.
You can also enter $99$ to end the game.

A pot of gold is randomly placed in the world except that the position cannot 
be $x=0$, $y=0$ (i.e., the initial position of your avatar.) You must write a 
while--loop to compute a position for the pot of gold until the position is not
$x=0$, $y=0$. The pseudocode is as follows:

\begin{Verbatim}
	gold_x = random integer between 0 and 4
	gold_y = random integer between 0 and 4
	while gold_x is 0 and gold_y is 0:
	    gold_x = random integer between 0 and 4
	    gold_y = random integer between 0 and 4
\end{Verbatim}

where \verb!gold_x! and \verb!gold_y! are the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the
pot of gold.

The game ends either when you enter $99$ to end the game or when you move onto
the same position as the pot of gold. When the game ends, the number of moves
is printed.

Your \verb!main! must look like the following:
\begin{console}
#include ...
#include ...

int main()
{
    std::cout << "seed: ";
    int n = 0;
    std::cin >> n;
    srand(n);

    // Your code here

    return 0;
}
\end{console}

You must use
\begin{console}
rand() % 5
\end{console}
to obtain a random integer between $0$ and $4$ (inclusive).

The test cases are not exhaustive. You should include your own test cases.

\textsc{Warning:} These test cases are only examples to illustrate the output
format for you. Yours will probably look different because of randomness.
