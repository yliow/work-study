According to Al Chemiz the amount of gold you can produce from 
x amount of air (cubic feet), 
y amount of water (gallons), 
z number of worms, 
i amount of wood (pounds) boiling at t temperature (celsius) is given by the following formula:
\[
x + \frac{y}{z+i} t^3
\]

Write a program that prompts the user for $x$, $y$, $z$, $i$, $t$ 
and prints the value for the above expression. 
Assume that the division is an integer division. 
Your program must pass the following tests:

(Note that when capturing several integer inputs from the keyboard using 
\verb!std::cin!, you can enter all inputs on one line separated by any 
whitespace such as a space or a tab.)

\textbf{Test 1}
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\underline{1 2 3 4 5}
1
\end{console}

\textbf{Test 2}
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\underline{5 4 3 2 1}
5
\end{console}

\textbf{Test 3}
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\underline{42 41 3 2 1}
50
\end{console}
