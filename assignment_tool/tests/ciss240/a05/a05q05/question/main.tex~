The following is not a program. You need to write your work to a text file.
You can use Notepad or some other text editor and save the file with the name
\verb!a05q05.txt!. (Talk to me or any of the senior CS tutors if you have never
used a text editor before.)

There is a boolean expression below. You need to evaluate it one operator at a
time, according to the standard precedence and associative rules. Note that
type casting is considered a step. There is also a rule below on removing
parentheses. Here's how you should present your work in the text file. For the
expression \verb!1 + 2 < 3 * 4!, if you believe the \verb!+! goes first,
followed by the \verb!<!, and then the \verb!*!,  you write your answer like
this in the file:
\begin{console}
// Name: John Doe
// File: a05q05.txt

1 + 2 < 3 * 4
= 3 < 3 * 4                                       by 1 + 2 = 3
= false * 4                                       by 3 < 3 = false
= 0 * 4                                           by int(false) = 0
= 0                                               by 0 * 4 = 0
= false                                           by bool(0) = false
\end{console}
Note that, in the above, there are \underline{two} type casts.

Of course the above is incorrect. The point is just to show you how to present
your work.

You need not follow the exactly column placement of the reasoning
that starts with \lq\lq by \dots\rq\rq. For instance, see another example
below where the placement is different.

Now I will show you how to remove parentheses. If you believe for the following
that the parenthesized expression should be evaluated first, followed by the
\verb!&&!, and finally by the \verb!||!, this is how you must present your
work:
\begin{console}
// Name: John Doe
// File: a05q05.txt

true && (2 < 3) || false
= true && (true) || false                 by 2 < 3 = true
= true && true || false                   by (true) = true
= true || false                           by true && true = true
= true                                    by true || false = true
\end{console}
Note that the removal of the parentheses is a step of its own; see the above
computation.

Now for the question. Evaluate the following expression according to the above
requirements:
\begin{verbatim}
    true || (2 + 3 < 5 - 1) && !(3 / 4 >= (5 + (2 - 1) * 2)) || (2 < 1)
\end{verbatim}
