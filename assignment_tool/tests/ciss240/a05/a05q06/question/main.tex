Q6. You are writing a tile--based dungeon--type game. The dungeon is made up of a
grid of rooms. A player can go from a room to an adjoining room. Each room is
labeled with a row number and a column number. Here's the overall plan of the
dungeon:
\begin{python}
from latextool_basic import *

p = Plot()
c = RectContainer(x=1, y=1, align='bottom', direction='top-to-bottom')
for row in range(-1, 8):
    c0 = RectContainer(x=1, y=1, align='bottom', direction='left-to-right')
    if row == -1:
        for col in range(-1, 10):
            if col == -1:
                c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.0, label = '')
            else:
                c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.0, label = r'\texttt{%s}' % col)
    else: 
        for col in range(-1, 10):
            if col == -1:
                c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.0, label = r'\texttt{%s}' % row)
            else:
                c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.05)
    c += c0
    c0.x = c0.x0; c0.y = c0.y0; c0.layout()


p += c
print(p)
\end{python}

Note that the row numbers are from $0$ to $7$ and the column numbers are from
$0$ to $9$. A player in the dungeon, of course, must stay in the dungeon. The
player's position is given by the \verb!row! and \verb!col! variable (obviously
of \verb!int! type). For instance, in the following state of the game, the
player is at \verb!row = 4! and \verb!col = 8!.
\begin{python}
from latextool_basic import *

p = Plot()
c = RectContainer(x=1, y=1, align='bottom', direction='top-to-bottom')
for row in range(-1, 8):
    c0 = RectContainer(x=1, y=1, align='bottom', direction='left-to-right')
    if row == -1:
        for col in range(-1, 10):
            if col == -1:
                c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.0, label = '')
            else:
                c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.0, label = r'\texttt{%s}' % col)
    else: 
        for col in range(-1, 10):
            if col == -1:
                c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.0, label = r'\texttt{%s}' % row)
            else:
                if row == 4 and col == 8:
                    c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.05, background='red')
                else:
                    c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.05)
    c += c0
    c0.x = c0.x0; c0.y = c0.y0; c0.layout()


p += c
print(p)
\end{python}

In addition, there are special rooms which are closed and the person cannot
enter these rooms (without special spells.)  Here are the special rooms:
\begin{python}
from latextool_basic import *

p = Plot()
c = RectContainer(x=1, y=1, align='bottom', direction='top-to-bottom')
for row in range(-1, 8):
    c0 = RectContainer(x=1, y=1, align='bottom', direction='left-to-right')
    if row == -1:
        for col in range(-1, 10):
            if col == -1:
                c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.0, label = '')
            else:
                c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.0, label = r'\texttt{%s}' % col)
    else: 
        for col in range(-1, 10):
            if col == -1:
                c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.0, label = r'\texttt{%s}' % row)
            else:
                if 1 <= row <= 2 and 2 <= col <= 8 or 5 <= row <= 6 and 4 <= col <= 7:
                    c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.05, background='black')
                else:
                    c0 += Rect2(x0=0, y0=0, x1 = 0.6, y1 = 0.6, linewidth=0.05)
    c += c0
    c0.x = c0.x0; c0.y = c0.y0; c0.layout()


p += c
print(p)
\end{python}

At the beginning of the game, you have to place a person in a regular (i.e.,
non--special) room. Your goal is to write a program that gets the position
(i.e., values for \verb!row! and \verb!col! in that order) and prints \verb!1!
if the position corresponds to a regular room. Otherwise (i.e., the room is
special or the position is outside the dungeon), your program prints \verb!0!.
You should use the simplest boolean expression.

Three test cases are included (only to show you the required input/output session
with the program.) You are strongly advised to include more test cases.

\resett
\nextt
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\userinput{0 8}
1
\end{console}

\nextt
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\userinput{5 7}
0
\end{console}

\nextt
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\userinput{100 100}
0
\end{console}
