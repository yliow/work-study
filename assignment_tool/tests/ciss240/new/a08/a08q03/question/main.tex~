The following program finds the integer roots within a range for a given cubic
polynomial. Recall that a cubic polynomial is a polynomial of degree three.
For instance
\[
	2x^3 + 5x^2 + (-1)x + 6
\]
is a cubic polynomial. We say that a real number $r$ is a root of the above
polynomial if when you substitute $x = r$ into the polynomial, you get zero:
\[
	 2r^3 + 5r^2 + (-1)r + 6 = 0
\]
For instance $x = 1$ is a root since
\[
	 2(1)^3 + 5(1)^2 + (-1)(1) + 6 = 2 + 5 â€“ 1 + 6 = 0
\]
The program accepts $6$ integers $a, b, c, d, e, f$ and lists the integers
from $e$ to $f$ (inclusive) which are roots of the polynomial
\[
	ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d
\]

\textbf{Test 1:}
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\underline{2 5 -1 -6 0 2}
1
\end{console}
(i.e., $1$ is the only integer root in $[0, 2]$ for $2x^3 + 5x^2 + -1x + -6$.)


\textbf{Test 2:}
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\underline{0 1 0 1 -10000 10000}

\end{console}
(i.e., $0x^3 + 1x^2 + 0x + 1$ does not have any integer root in
$[-10000, 10000]$.)


\textbf{Test 3:}
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\underline{1 0 -1 0 -100 100}
-1 0 1
\end{console}
(i.e., -$1, 0,$ and $1$ are the integer roots of $1x3 + 0x2 + -1x + 0$ in
$[-100, 100]$.)
