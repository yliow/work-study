Q4. This is a continuation of Q3.
(In other words, after you finished Q3, copy the files from Q3
to the directory/folder for Q4.)

Now include a function to multiply fractions in your library.
Test it throughly.
The name of the function must be \verb!Fraction_mult!.
(There's only one reasonable prototype of this function.)

You must add a test function to the main C++ file and allow user to test
your function when the user enters option 4. (Refer to Q2.)
Previous code for testing with option 1, 2, and 3 must be kept.
