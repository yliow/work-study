For this assignment, you will implement a library for
modeling fractions.
Each fraction is modeled (of course) with two integer variables
(to model the numerator and denominator).
The ideas present in this assignment will be used again in a later assignment
when you \lq\lq combine'' two integer variable into a single variable.

The questions build on top of each other until the last one.
Therefore you should start with Q1, when you are done with Q1, copy the code to Q2, etc.
The first 8 questions are very simple.
In fact the first few questions already appear in the review set.
You will then use the library to factorize polynomials of degree 3 (the last two questions).
The only one that really requires more work is Q10.
