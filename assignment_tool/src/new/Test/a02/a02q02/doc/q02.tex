This is a continuation of Q1.
(In other words, after you finished Q1, copy the files from Q1
to the directory/folder for Q2.)

Now include a function to add fractions in your library.
Test it throughly.
I will not supply test cases since you should know how to add fractions!

See the skeleton code below for the prototype.

Note that, as stated in the comments for the function to add fractions,
the add function does \textit{not} simplify the fraction, i.e.,
it does \textit{not} perform reduction of the fraction
by divide the numerator and denominator by the greatest common divisor.
