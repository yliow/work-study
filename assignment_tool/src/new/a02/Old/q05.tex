This is a continuation of Q4.

Now include a function to divide fractions in your library.
Test it throughly.
The name of the function must be \verb!Fraction_div!.
(There's only one reasonable prototype of this function.)

You must add a test function to the main C++ file and allow user to test
your function when the user enters option 5. (Refer to Q2.)
Previous code for testing with option 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be kept.
