The goal is to compute the big-$O$ of the best and worst
runtime performance
of the following algorithm. 
Here's the algorithm:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
INPUT:  x - array of doubles
        n - size of x
        a - int
OUTPUT: None
ALGORITHM:

    a = x[0] / 2                               

    for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 100000:

        if a < 100:
            for j = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1:
                x[i] = x[i] + a                

            for j = 0, 1, 2, ..., (n-1)/2:
                if x[j] < 5:                   
                    x[j] = x[j] * x[0]         

\end{Verbatim}

(During your analysis, just treat $n - 1$ as though it's even so that 
$(n - 1)/2$ is an integer.)

(a) Write down the big-O of $T_b(n)$ as $O(n^k)$
where $k$ is the smallest possible positive integer.
(You are strongly advised to write down the precise expression
for $T_b(n)$ on your own. 
For grading purposes, you just have to write down the big-O of $T_b(n)$.)

(b) Write down the big-O of $T_w(n)$ as $O(n^k)$
where $k$ is the smallest possible positive integer.
(You are strongly advised to write down the precise expression
for $T_w(n)$ on your own. 
For grading purposes, you just have to write down the big-O of $T_w(n)$.)
