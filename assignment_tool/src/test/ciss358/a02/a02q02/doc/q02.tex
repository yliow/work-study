Consider the following fact:
Every positive integer $n \geq 1$ is a product of primes.
For instance for $n = 20$,
the ordered collection of primes involved are $(2, 2, 5)$ (in ascending order).
We define the product of the empty collection of primes, i.e. $()$, to be $1$.
Of course the collection can have one single number:
If the collection is $(11)$, then the product is 11.

Define $P(n)$ to be the above statement, i.e.,
\[
  P(n) =
  \biggl(
  \text{Every positive integer $n \geq 1$ is a product of primes}
  \biggr)
\]
Give a complete proof of $P(n)$ for all $n \geq 1$
using strong or weak induction.
Here, I'm giving you the $P(n)$ for free.

You can assume Euclid's lemma: If $p$ is a prime dividing $ab$,
then $p$ divides $a$ or $p$ divides $b$.

(In fact not only is every positive integer $n$ representable
as a product of primes,
it is represented as a product of primes in a \textit{unique way}.
In other words, the ordered collection of primes for $n$ is unique.
This can also be proven using induction.
But you don't have to prove it.)
