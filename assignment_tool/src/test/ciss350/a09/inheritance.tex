\textsc{Inheritance}

It's actually possible to subclass class templates.
You do not have to do it for this assignment.
You can read up on it.
If you do use inheritance, it will save you some code
since many methods and operators and functions
for all the above three classes are actually very similar.

(My recommendation is that do \textit{not}
  try template inheritance first.
I strongly suggest you finish the assignment
first -- or at least 2 problems -- before you
try to combine them into an inheritance hierarchy.)
