\textsc{The STL vector and list classes}

Make sure your study and run the following program.
Also, check my notes.
Search for C++ references on the web -- example: \verb!www.cppreference.com!
or \verb!www.cplusplus.com!.

The STL \verb!list! class is implemented using double-ended queues.
The STL \verb!vector! class is implemented using dynamic arrays.
However the methods/operators supported by the vector class are very similar.

Although they have many similarly named methods/operators,
you have to understand that the implementation is different and therefore
the runtime complexities can be different.
For instance the \verb!push_back! of the \verb!std::list!
class has a worst runtime of $O(1)$.
The worst runtime for the \verb!push_back! method of
the \verb!std::vector! class is of course $O(n)$
where $n$ is the size since for the vector class, inserting at the back
when the size reaches the capacity, requires allocating a new dynamic array
in the heap and copying $n$ values from the old array to the new

Make sure you convert the above program to the vector version.
You will see that the vector class does not have a \verb!push_front! method.
