\section{Other big-O Classes}

XXX

So far we have big-O classes for polynomials, logarithms, and 
exponentials (as well as their products).

There are other big-O classes for functions like
\[
n^n, \,\,\,\,\, n!
\]
Clearly
\[
n! \leq n^n
\]
just by looking
\[
1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots n \leq n \cdot n \cdot n \cdots n
\]
So clearly
\[
O(n!) \subseteq O(n^n)
\]
Could the two classes be the same?
Is it possible for a large enough constant multiple of $n!$
to beat $n^n$?

[TODO: subexponential, superexponential, etc.]
