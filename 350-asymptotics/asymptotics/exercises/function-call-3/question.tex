Give me a simple function of a function \verb!f()! that called
  function \verb!g()! and the space complexity is highest when
  the program execution is at a point in \verb!f()! instead of
  in \verb!g()!.
  The point: it does \textit{not} mean that you use more memory
  if the stack of function calls is larger.
