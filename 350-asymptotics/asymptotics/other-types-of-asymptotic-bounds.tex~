\section{Other Types of Asymptotics Bounds}

Recall that $f = O(g)$ (or $f \in O(g)$) is some kind of inequality:
a multiple of $g$ bounds $f$ from above.
We also say that $f$ is \defterm{asymptotically bounded above} by $g$.

Here's another type of asymptotic bound:

We write $f \in \Omega(g)$ if
there exist $C$ and $N$ such that 
for $n \geq N$,
\[
C|g(n)| \leq |f(n)|
\]
In other words a multiple of $g$ bounds $f$ from below.
We also say that $f$ is \defterm{asymptotically bounded below} by $g$.

You can put the two definitions together and get this definition:
$f = \Theta(g)$ if $f \in O(g)$ and $f \in \Omega(g)$.
We will say in this case that $f$ is \defterm{asymptotically
equivalent to} $g$.

Here are some basic facts you should know. For the following $f$,
$g$, $f_i$, and $g_i$ are functions.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item $O(cf) = O(f)$, $\Omega(cf) = \Omega(f)$, $\Theta(cf) =
 \Theta(f)$
 \item $\Omega(f) \subseteq O(f) \cap \Theta(f)$
 \item If $f_i = O(g_i)$ $(i=1,2)$ then
 \[
  f_1+f_2 = O \bigl( \max(|g_1|,|g_2|) \bigr), \,\,\, f_1 f_2 \in O(g_1 g_2)
 \]
 \item $f_i = O(g)$ $(i=1,2)$ $\implies$ $f_1+f_2 = O(g)$
 \item $f \in O(g)$ $\implies$ $O(f) \subseteq O(g)$.
\end{enumerate}


Besides {\it inequality} types asymptotic bounds, there are two other
{\it limit} types asymptotic properties:




\begin{comment}
\begin{itemize}
\li We write ? if
\[
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 1
\]
This just means more or less that $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ approaches each other
as $n$ grows.
For instance
\[
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n^2 + 1000\ln n}{n^2 + 10000n\sin(n)}
= 1
\]
This does {\it not} mean that they actually meet, i.e., 
it does not mean that there is some $N$ such that 
for $n \geq N$, $f(n) = g(n)$.
\li We write ? if 
\[
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 0
\]
Informally,
this means that $g(n)$ kills off $f(n)$ as large $n$.
For instance
\[
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n + 1000}{n^2 + 1} = 0
\]
