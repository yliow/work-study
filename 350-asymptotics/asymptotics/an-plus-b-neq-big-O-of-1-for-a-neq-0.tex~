\section{$an+b \neq O(1)$ for $a \neq 0$}

Now I want to do something different.
So far we have been showing $f(n) = O(g(n))$.
Now I want to do a case where $f(n) \neq O(g(n))$.

Let $f(n) = n$ and $g(n) = 5$.
I want to show you that $f(n) \neq O(g(n))$, i.e.
\[
n \neq O(5)
\]
This means that you {\it cannot} find $N$ and $C$ such that
if $n \geq N$, then $|f(n)| \leq C|g(n)|$.

This means that no matter what you choose for $C$ and $N$, 
there is always some $n_0 \geq N$ such that 
\[
|f(n_0)| > C|g(n_0)|
\]

For our case this means that no matter what you choose for $C$
and $N$,
there is always one $n_0 \geq N$ such that 
\[
|n_0| > C|5|
\]
i.e.
\[
|n_0| > 5C
\]

This is obvously the case since there are infinitely many integers:
If you give me a $C$ and an $N$, I can always find an integer 
$n_0$ greater than $N$ and also greater than $5C$ and greater than $0$.
The fact that $n_0$ is greater than $0$ means that $|n_0| = n_0$

You may assume the following fact:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] If $x$ is a real number, then there is some real number
$y$ such that $x < y$.
\item[(b)] If $x$ is a real number, then there is some integer
$n$ such that $x < n$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{eg}
Let $f(n) = n$ and $g(n) = 5$. Then $f(n) \neq O(g(n))$, 
i.e., $n \neq O(5)$.
\end{eg}

{\it Solution.}
Let $C$ and $N$ be any real numbers.
Choose $n_0$ to be an integer greater than 
$\max(0, 5C, N)$, for instance,
\[
n_0 = \ceiling{\max(0, 5C, N)} + 1
\]
Then $n_0 > 0$, $n_0 > 5C$, and $n_0 > N$.
Since $n_0 > 0$, we have $|n_0| = n_0$.
We have
\begin{align*}
n_0 &> 5C \\
\THEREFORE |n_0| &> C \cdot |5| \\
\THEREFORE |f(n_0)| &> C \cdot |g(n_0)|
\end{align*}
Therefore $f(n) \neq O(g(n))$.
\qed

Let me repeat:
If you want to show $f(n) \neq O(g(n))$, you need to show that
given any $C$ and $N$, there is some $n_0$ such that
$n_0 \geq N$ and 
\[
|f(n_0)| > C |g(n_0)|
\]
Get it?
