With Q1 done, you can now make your BST objects self-balancing by including
balancing after an insert or a remove operation.
Make sure check the notes for left and right rotations and when/how
they are used after a BST insert and a BST remove.

The name of the class is \verb!AVL! and it should have all the
methods in the BST class from Q1.
Like the BST case, you only need to write AVL trees of integer values.
Note that almost all methods are the same as the methods in BST (Q1).

Make sure you test your AVL insert and remove thoroughly.

(After you're done with Q2, as a personal project, you should convert this into
a class template.)
