The format of your program must look like this:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
// Name: smaug
// File: a01q01.cpp

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    *** YOUR WORK HERE ***
    return 0;
}
\end{Verbatim}
replacing \lq\lq John Doe'' with your name.
In particular:
\begin{enumerate}
\item You must have your name and the name of the file at the top of each 
C++ source file as shown above.
\item The last thing printed must be a newline.
\end{enumerate}

Read the questions carefully before diving in.

Note that you should create a new project for each question. 
For easy maintenance of your assignments, 
I suggest you have a folder \verb!ciss350! somewhere in your 
\verb!My Documents!, 
and in that you have a folder 
\verb!a!, 
and in folder a you have a folder 
\verb!a01!, 
and you have solutions folders 
\verb!a01q01!,
\verb!a01q02!, etc. in the folder 
\verb!a01!:


\begin{verbatim}
  .
  .
  .
  ciss350
  |
  +- a
     |
     +- a01
        |
        +- a01q01
        |
        +- a01q02
\end{verbatim}
