The \texttt{DLNode} and \verb!DLList! class is analogous to the classes
in Q2 except that these are doubly-linked.
Furthermore you must implement the \verb!DLList! using 
sentinel nodes:
\begin{console}[fontsize=\footnotesize]
class DLList
{
private:
    DLNode head_sentinel_;
    DLNode tail_sentinel_;
};
\end{console}
Note that the \verb!head_sentinel_.prev_! is \verb!NULL!
while  \verb!tail_sentinel_.next_! is \verb!NULL!.

The corresponding node class of course looks like this:
{\small
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,fontsize=\footnotesize]
template < typename T >
class DLNode
{
public:
    DLNode(const T & key, DLNode * prev=NULL, DLNode * next=NULL)
        : key_(key), next_(next), prev_(prev)
    {}

private:
    T key_;
    DLNode * prev_;
    DLNode * next_;
};
\end{Verbatim}

Implement the above classes with methods completely analogous to those in 
Q2.

\textsc{Recall:}
Although a \verb!DLList! object has the same behavior
as a \verb!SLList! object, recall that the runtime
is very different.
For instance inserting at the tail of a \verb!SLList! has a runtime of
$O(n)$ where $n$ is the size of the list whereas
for a \verb!DLList! object, the runtime is $O(1)$.
