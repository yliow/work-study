\textsc{Skeleton for all code}

For each question, the following skeleton must be used (every implementation
accepts a vector parameter and two other parameters --
refer to questions for details):
{\footnotesize
\includesourcenonumbers{skeleton.cpp}
}

For instance for Q1, if you run 
\begin{console}[fontsize=\footnotesize]
./a.out 42 1000000 100 5 1
\end{console}
then you are seeding the random generator with 42, sorting a vector
of 1000000 integer values randomly chosen in the range 0..99
a total of 5 times and printing the
average runtime of sorting algorithm.
The average time in this case is the total time for the 5 runs 
divided by 5.
