\textsc{Notes.}
\begin{tightlist}
  \item  C++ STL set (\verb!std::set!) is implemented as a tree and not
  hashtable.
  \item Python implements its
  \verb!set! class (and also \verb!frozenset! class)
  by using its dictionary (which is a hashtable)
  with the value part occupied by some dummy value.
