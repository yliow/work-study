Comparing hashtable set and BST set

Using the implementation from Q3, create a set of 100,000 random integers
and find the time taken to find 1,000 values in this set.
Next, use your BST and do the same.
Next repeat the above with
a set of 200,000 random integers.
Etc.
Compare the time and plot a graph.
