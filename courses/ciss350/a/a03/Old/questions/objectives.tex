\textsc{Objectives:}
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt]
\item View problems recursively
\item Write recursive functions
\end{enumerate}


The skeleton code given for each question must be used.
The trace printing in the code cannot be removed.
(Just as in CISS245, the skeleton code is of course not complete
and might have errors. The point is to give you something to begin your
work.)
