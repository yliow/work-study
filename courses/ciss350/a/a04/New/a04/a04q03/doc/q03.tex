The goal is to compute the big-$O$ of the runtime performance
of the following algorithm. 
(The best, worst, and average runtimes are the same.)
Here's the algorithm:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
INPUT:  x - array of doubles
        n - size of x
        a - int
OUTPUT: None
ALGORITHM:

    a = a * a                              

    for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1:
        x[i] = x[i] + a                    

        for j = 0, 1, 2, ..., i:
            x[j] = x[i] * a                

\end{Verbatim}

(a) Write down $T(n)$ in terms of $n$ and the $t_1, t_2, ...$.
You should write it as a polynomial of $n$ from the highest
degree term to the lowest.

(b) Write down the big-$O$ of $T(n)$ as $O(n^k)$
where $k$ is the smallest possible  positive integer.

\textsc{solution}\\
(a) 
The timings with the number of times a statement is executed
is as follows (complete it like the solution given earlier):
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,commandchars]
           a = a * a               time t1

           i = 0                   time t2
LOOP1:     if i >= n:              time t3
               goto ENDLOOP1       time t4
           x[i] = x[i] + a         time t5

           j = 0                   time t6
LOOP2:     if j > i:               time t7
               goto ENDLOOP2       time t8
           x[j] = x[i] * a         time t9
           j = j + 1               time t10
           goto LOOP2              time t11
ENDLOOP2:
           i = i + 1               time t12
           goto LOOP1              time t13
ENDLOOP1:
\end{Verbatim}
