The goal is to compute the big-$O$ of the runtime performance
of the following algorithm. 
(The best, worst, and average runtimes are the same.)
Here's the algorithm:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
INPUT:  x - array of doubles
        n - size of x
        a - int
OUTPUT: None
ALGORITHM:

    a = a * a                              

    for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1:
        x[i] = x[i] + a                    

        for j = 0, 1, 2, ..., i:
            x[j] = x[i] * a                

\end{Verbatim}

(a) Write down $T(n)$ in terms of $n$ and the $t_1, t_2, ...$.
You should write it as a polynomial of $n$ from the highest
degree term to the lowest.

(b) Write down the big-$O$ of $T(n)$ as $O(n^k)$
where $k$ is the smallest possible  positive integer.
