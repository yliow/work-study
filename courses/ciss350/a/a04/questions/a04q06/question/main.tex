State the big-O of the runtime of the following sorting algorithm
\begin{console}
INPUT:   x - array
         n - size of array x

ALGORITHM:

for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 2:
    for j = 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 2:
        if x[j] < x[j + 1]:
            t = x[j]
            x[j] = x[j + 1]
            x[j + 1] = t

\end{console}

(You are strongly advised to translate the above to code
that allows you compute the runtime and then  
write down the precise $T(n)$. For grading purposes
you just have to write down the big-O of $T(n)$.)
