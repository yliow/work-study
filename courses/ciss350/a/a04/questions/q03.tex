(a) 
The timings with the number of times a statement is executed
is as follows (complete it like the solution given earlier):
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,commandchars]
           a = a * a               time t1

           i = 0                   time t2
LOOP1:     if i >= n:              time t3
               goto ENDLOOP1       time t4
           x[i] = x[i] + a         time t5

           j = 0                   time t6
LOOP2:     if j > i:               time t7
               goto ENDLOOP2       time t8
           x[j] = x[i] * a         time t9
           j = j + 1               time t10
           goto LOOP2              time t11
ENDLOOP2:
           i = i + 1               time t12
           goto LOOP1              time t13
ENDLOOP1:
\end{Verbatim}
