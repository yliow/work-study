The following is taken from wikipedia.org:

{\it The Gregorian calendar, the current standard calendar in most of the 
world, adds a 29th day to February in all years evenly divisible by 4, 
except for centennial years (those ending in 00), which receive the extra 
day only if they are evenly divisible by 400. Thus 1600, 2000 and 2400 
are leap years but 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2100 are not.}

Write a program that prompts the user for a year and prints either 
\verb!leap year! or \verb!not leap year! according to the above rule.

\resett
\nextt
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\userinput{1991}
not leap year
\end{console}

\nextt
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\userinput{2004}
leap year
\end{console}

\nextt
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\userinput{1200}
leap year
\end{console}
