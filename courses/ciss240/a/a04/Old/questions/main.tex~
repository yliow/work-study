\objectives{
 \begin{enumerate}
   \li Declare \texttt{double} variables
   \li Use \texttt{double} operators
   \li Use \texttt{double} functions
   \li Perform input and output for \texttt{double} variables/values
 \end{enumerate}
}


Note that doubles take up more memory than integers and furthermore 
operations on doubles take
more time than integer operations. 
Therefore as much as possible integer variables should be used.
Points will be taken off for using double variables unnecessarily.

For question 1, name your C++ source file \texttt{a04q01.cpp}.
For question 2, name your C++ source file \texttt{a04q02.cpp}.
Etc.
 
As before, your program's interaction (input and output) must following 
exactly what was specified. 
Do
NOT deviate from what was given.
In the test cases, user inputs are underlined.

In the top comment, you must include a short description of what the program 
does. 
Here's an example from a04q01 of how to do that:

\begin{console}
// Name: John Doe
// File: a04q01.cpp
//
// Description
// This program promppts the user for a, b, c and prints the solutions to
// the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. This program assumes that the
// polynomial ax^2 + bx + c has two real roots.

int main()
\end{console}
