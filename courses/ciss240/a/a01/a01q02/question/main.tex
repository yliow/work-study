Q2. Write a C++ program that produces the following output:
\begin{console}[numbers=left]
Table of cubes
==============

n       n^3
---     ---
0       0
1       1
2       8
3       27
4       64

\end{console}
You must use only one 
\verb!std::cout! in your code. 
Do not use the tab character. 
Make sure you count the spaces in the above output correctly.

For your convenience, line numbers are included in the above output.
These line numbers are not part of your program output.
