When given data points which do not form a smooth curve (example: stock price),
one technique of smoothing the data points is to compute the
\underline{\bf moving average}. The following is the computation of a moving average
with a window size of $3$, meaning to say that the averages are computed with
three values.

Suppose the values are
\[
a0 \hspace{2 cm} a1 \hspace{2 cm} a2 \hspace{2 cm} a3 \hspace{2 cm} a4
\hspace{2 cm} a5
\]
Then the moving average (with the window size of $3$) is
\[
a0 \hspace{1 cm} a1 \hspace{1 cm} \frac{a0 + a1 + a2}{3} \hspace{1 cm}
\frac{a1 + a2 + a3}{3} \hspace{1 cm} \frac {a2 + a3 + a4}{3} \hspace{1 cm}
\frac{a3 + a4 + a5}{3}
\]

For instance, if the data is
\[
\hspace{2 cm} 1.2 \hspace{2 cm} 2.5 \hspace{2 cm} 2.0 \hspace{2 cm} 3.4
\hspace{2 cm} 2.3 \hspace{2 cm} 2.6
\]
then the moving average (with the window size $3$) is
\[
\hspace{1.5 cm} 1.2 \hspace{1.5 cm} 2.5 \hspace{1.5 cm} 1.9 \hspace{1.5 cm} 2.6333
\hspace{1.5 cm} 2.5667 \hspace{1.5 cm} 2.7667
\]
(example: $(1.2 + 2.5 + 2.0) / 3$ is $1.9$). Note that, for this case, the
averaging process begins only at the third term; there are not enough terms to
average for the first two.

Now for the programming assignment.

Write a program that prompts the user for $10$ doubles and a window size,
places the doubles in an array, and computes the moving average with the window
size specified by the user; the window size refers to the number of terms to
use in the computation of the average. Your program should output the moving
averages with consecutive values separated by a space. You should display $4$
decimal places in your output. The input from the user must be placed in a
double array of size $10$. Computations of the moving averages must be done
with this array.

(There are other techniques to smooth data points.)

\underline{1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1}
1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000
\end{Verbatim}

\nextt
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}]
\underline{1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 4}
1.0000 2.0000 3.0000 2.5000 3.5000 4.5000 5.5000 6.5000 7.5000 8.5000
\end{Verbatim}
(Note that the window size is $4$. Therefore the fourth value in the array is
$2.5000$ because this is the value of $(1+ 2 + 3 + 4) / 4.0$. Etc.)
