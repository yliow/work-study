Q3. An intercept missile is capable of exploding and disabling an enemy missile if
it is sufficiently close to the latter. The position $(x,y,z)$ of the enemy
missile is continually collected by a radar mounted on the intercept missile.
The distance between two points $(x,y,z)$ and $(0,0,0)$ (the position of the
intercept missile) in $3$--dimensions is given by the formula
\[\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\]
($3$--dimensional Pythagorus formula). Write a program that detects whether the
distance from the enemy missile to the intercept missile is sufficiently close
for the intercept missile to explode. Your program accepts $4$ doubles: The
first three values gives the $(x,y,z)$ position of the enemy missile from the
intercept missile and the last is the maximum distance the intercept should
explode to disable the enemy missile. Your program must set a boolean variable
to true exactly when the intercept missile should explode and then print this
boolean variable.
