Brute-force search for integer solutions in mod $n$

Find all solutions to this problem:
\begin{center}
$x * x\,\%\,n = a\,\%\,n$ \\
$x \text{ is an integer between } 0 \text{ and } n - 1$
\end{center}

Note that this means that we are only interested in remainders mod $n$
(that's why we are only interested in $0, 1, 2, \dots, n - 1$.) Using the
correct mathematical notation in Computer Science (especially in the area of
Cryptography) one would say that we're solving this equation:
\[x * x \equiv a \pmod n\]
or
\[x^2 \equiv a \pmod n\]

The program prompts the user for $n$ and $a$, prints all the solutions, and
prints the number of solutions. 

Let's do one by hand. Let's try $n = 5$ and $a = 1$. Then, the equation we are
looking at is this:
\begin{center}
$(x * x)\,\%\,5 = 1\,\%\,5$ \\
$x$ is an integer between $0$ and $4$
\end{center}
i.e.,
\begin{center}
$(x * x)\,\%\,5 = 1$ \\
$x$ is an integer between $0$ and $4$
\end{center}

Next, we try all the integers from $0$ to $4$ and see which one is a solution:
\begin{longtable}{|c|c|} \hline
$x$ & $(x * x)\,\%\,5$ \\ \hline
$0$ & $(0 * 0)\,\%\,5 = 0\,\%\,5 = 0$ \\ \hline
$1$ & $(1 * 1)\,\%\,5 = 1\,\%\,5 = 1$ \\ \hline
$2$ & $(2 * 2)\,\%\,5 = 4\,\%\,5 = 4$ \\ \hline
$3$ & $(3 * 3)\,\%\,5 = 9\,\%\,5 = 4$ \\ \hline
$4$ & $(4 * 4)\,\%\,5 = 16\,\%\,5 = 1$ \\ \hline
\end{longtable}
The solutions are $x = 1, x = 4$. (See \textsc{Test 1}.)

(Note: Is it true that there are always either none or exactly two solutions
when $n$ is prime?)
