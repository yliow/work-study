\chapter{Frontpage}

I hope one day I have notes (openbooks) for all my classes so that students won't have to spend 100s of dollars on books. This is one of them. It's still under heavy construction.


\section{Goal}
Learn C++ programming, learn some CS stuff, and have fun.


\section{Audience}
Anyone who can read, has access to a computer, feels comfortable using a computer, has some basic math background, and most importantly, wants to learn.


\section{Disclaimer}
I hope the number of errors in this set of notes is close to zero. Please report bugs to yliow@ccis.edu.


\section{Acknowledgments}
