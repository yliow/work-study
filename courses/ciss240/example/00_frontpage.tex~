I hope one day I have notes (openbooks) for all my classes so that students won't have to spend 100s of dollars on books. This is one of them. It's still under heavy construction.


Goal
Learn C++ programming, learn some CS stuff, and have fun.


Audience
Anyone who can read, has access to a computer, feels comfortable using a computer, has some basic math background, and most importantly, wants to learn.


Disclaimer
I hope the number of errors in this set of notes is close to zero. Please report bugs to yliow@ccis.edu.
