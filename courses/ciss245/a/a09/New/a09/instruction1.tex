\textsc{Aside.}
Note that all \verb!mystring! objects can represent a string of at most 1024 characters. This is a
problem. For instance suppose I want to do an AI chatbot.
Clearly I need to process strings. If I use your
\verb!mystring!, then I'm probably wasting a lot of memory. Most people don't type that many characters for
each response during a chat session. 300 is probably more than enough. On the other hand if I am
writing a system to analyze web documents (like what Google is doing this instant on thousands of
machines), then I probably will need way more than 1024 characters for each web document.
