This is a continuation of Q6.

Now include a function to check when two fractions are not the same.
Test it throughly.
The name of the function must be \verb!Fraction_neq!.
The function returns a boolean value.
(There's only one reasonable prototype of this function.)

Note that you must use the \verb!Fraction_eq! function, i.e.,
you must call the \verb!Fraction_eq! function.
In fact this function should be very easy.

You must add a test function to the main C++ file and allow user to test
your function when the user enters option 7. (Refer to Q2.)
Previous code for testing with option 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 must be kept.
