\textsc{Type conversion functions}

Frequently types don't work alone. You usually want to convert data from one
form to another. The most obvious features we want for our \verb!Fraction!
library is to work with integers and doubles.

Here are some of the ways we want our functions to work:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
Fraction f = get_Fraction(1, 2);

double d = get_double(f);             // d has value 0.5
int i = get_int(get_Fraction(12, 5)); // i has value 2, essentially the 
                                      // int value of 12.0/5
\end{Verbatim}

What are the appropriate prototypes for the \verb!get_double()! and
\verb!get_int()! functions?
