\texttt{\bf operator*}

Define \verb!operator*! so that when \verb!operator*! is called with two
\verb!Fraction! variables, the return value is a \verb!Fraction! value that
models the product of the fractions in the \lq\lq real" world. So what's the
appropriate prototype?

Mathematically, this is how you multiply fractions:
\[
\frac{a}{b} \cdot
\frac{c}{d} =
\frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}
\]

Don't forget to add the prototype to \verb!Fraction.h! and the test code to
your \verb!main()!. This should be test option 4.

\textbf{Test 1:}
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}]
\underline{4 2 3 11 17}
22/51
\end{Verbatim}

Also, from now on, I won't provide you test cases. It's your job to add more
test cases to your \verb!stdin.txt! and test your code as thoroughly as
possible.
