Write the string comparison function
{\small
\begin{console}
int str_cmp(char x[], char y[]);
\end{console}
}
Add this prototype to \verb!mystring.h!
and implement the function in \verb!mystring.cpp!.

The function returns 0 when the two strings \verb!x! and \verb!y!
are the same, i.e., the characters of \verb!x! up to \verb!'\0'! 
matches exactly the characters of \verb!y! up to \verb!'\0'!.
If they are different, then 1 is returned.

The file \verb!main.cpp! should look like this:
