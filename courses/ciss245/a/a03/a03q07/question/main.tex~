Write a chat bot.
The chat bot will learn to recognize the user.
Here's a test run:
\begin{console}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
Hi, what is your name?
\underline{My name is John.}
Hi John. How are you?
\end{console}

The chat bot must recognize the name of the user when given responses of the
following form:
\begin{tightlist}
  \li \verb!My name is John.!
  \li \verb!I am John.!
  \li \verb!I'm John.!
  \li \verb!John.!
\end{tightlist}
and also when the user enters extraneous spaces such as
\begin{tightlist}
  \li \verb!My     name  is       John.!
  \li \verb!I  am    John.!
  \li \verb!I'm   John.  !
  \li \verb!John.    !
\end{tightlist}
and also when the user forgot to enter the period (\verb!'.'!)
and when the user forgets to capitalize correctly such as
\begin{tightlist}
  \li \verb!my     name  is       john.!
  \li \verb!i  am    john.!
  \li \verb!i'm   john.  !
  \li \verb!john.    !
\end{tightlist}

It's helpful to write a \verb!str_capitalize()! function such that
\verb!str_capitalize(x)! will replace \verb!x[0]! with
its uppercase.
It's also useful to have a function that strips away
left trailing space, \verb!str_lstrip! so that if you
execute
\verb!str_lstrip(x)!
where \verb!x! is
\verb!"   hello world   "!,
\verb!x! becomes
\verb!"hello world   "!.

Q8.
The next thing that the chat bot does is to be helpful to the user:
\begin{console}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
Hi, what is your name?
\underline{My name is John.}
Hi John. How are you?
\underline{I'm sad.}
I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you sad?
\end{console}
Again, the chat bot must recognize the following variations:
\begin{tightlist}
  \li \verb!I'm sad.!
  \li \verb!i'm sad.!
  \li \verb!I am sad.!
  \li \verb!i am sad.!
  \li \verb!Sad.!
  \li \verb!sad!
\end{tightlist}
as well as without period and with extraneous spaces.
Your chat bot must also recognize \verb!depressed! and \verb!miserable! (you can add
other synonyms if you like).
So here's another chat session:
\begin{console}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
Hi, what is your name?
\underline{John}
Hi John. How are you?
\underline{I'm depressed.}
I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you depressed?
\end{console}

The chat bot must also respond to the following emotions:
\verb!happy!, \verb!glad!.
(You can add others if you like.)
Here's another chat session:
\begin{console}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
Hi, what is your name?
\underline{My name is John.}
Hi John. How are you?
\underline{I'm happy.}
I'm glad to hear that. Why are you happy?
\end{console}

Your chat bot must also recognize words like \verb!very!, \verb!extremely!, and \verb!really!.
\begin{console}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
Hi, what is your name?
\underline{My name is John.}
Hi John. How are you?
\underline{I'm very sad.}
I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you so sad?
\end{console}
(Note the new word \verb!so! when the user adds \verb!very!.)

Once the user respond, the program does this:
\begin{console}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
Hi, what is your name?
\underline{My name is John.}
Hi John. How are you?
\underline{I'm very sad.}
I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you sad?
\underline{My dog died.}
I'm sorry. Tell me about your dog.
\end{console}
Here's another execution:
\begin{console}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
Hi, what is your name?
\underline{My name is John.}
Hi John. How are you?
\underline{I'm very sad.}
I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you sad?
\underline{My goldfish died.}
I'm sorry. Tell me about your goldfish.
\end{console}

Your program should respond to a general statement like:
\begin{console}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
Hi, what is your name?
\underline{My name is John.}
Hi John. How are you?
\underline{I'm very sad.}
I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you sad?
\underline{My [pet/friend/relative/etc.] died.}
I'm sorry. Tell me about your [pet/friend/relative/etc.].
\end{console}

On the happy side, your program should do this:
You program should respond to a general statement like:
\begin{console}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
Hi, what is your name?
\underline{My name is John.}
Hi John. How are you?
\underline{I'm very happy.}
I'm glad to hear that. Why are you happy?
\underline{I got a raise.}
I'm glad. Tell me about your raise.
\end{console}
or
\begin{console}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
Hi, what is your name?
\underline{My name is John.}
Hi John. How are you?
\underline{I'm very happy.}
I'm glad to hear that. Why are you happy?
\underline{I bought a car.}
I'm glad. Tell me about your car.
\end{console}

You only need to handle
\verb!got!,
\verb!bought!, and 
\verb!received!.

Q9.
The last thing to add is a certain amount of randomness.
Instead of always
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
Hi, what is your name?
\end{Verbatim}
vary it randomly with
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
Hello, what is your name?
\end{Verbatim}
(Of course use the random number generator).
And instead of
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you sad?
\end{Verbatim}
or
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
I'm glad to hear that. Why are you happy?
\end{Verbatim}
vary it randomly with
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
I'm so sorry to hear that. Why are you sad?
\end{Verbatim}
or
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
I'm so glad to hear that. Why are you happy?
\end{Verbatim}
and
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
I'm sorry to hear that. Tell me why you are sad.
\end{Verbatim}
or
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,commandchars=\\\{\}]
I'm glad to hear that. Tell me why you are happy.
\end{Verbatim}

You are of course encouraged to write more string functions
to clean up your main program.

(This simple chat bot is just an illustration of
what you can do to simulate human behavior -- and of course it is also a practice on string processing.
To create a strong AI bot requires a lot more work.)
