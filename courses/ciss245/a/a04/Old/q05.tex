  [Pointers and memory management]

This is a practice on using pointers and the free store (memory heap).

The goal is to
write a function \verb!pi()! (not the number \verb!pi = 3.14159...!)
such that \verb!pi(x)! is the number of primes $\leq$ \verb!x!.
\verb!x! is a \verb!double!.
We'll use the
sieve of Eratosthenes.
This was mentioned in CISS240.
See next page for a review of the algorithm.
Here's the skeleton code:

\begin{comment}
In function \verb!pi()!, other than variable \verb!ret!, all
other variables must be pointers.

(Note: Again, this is a practice on using pointers and the memory heap.
It is actually more natural to use integer variables rather than pointers
in your function.)

The following skeleton code must be used.
Do not modify \verb!main()!.
