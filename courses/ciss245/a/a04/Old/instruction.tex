\textsc{Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\li Your program must be well-written. 
    You must follow the style in your notes as closely as possible. 
    Take note of the spaces and blank lines I used in my examples. 
    Badly written programs will very likely result in a poor grade for this 
    assignment. 
    Points will be taken off for sloppy work. 
\li It's important to remember this: In your printouts of your \cpp\ source
files, 
    there must be no wraparound. So each line of text in your C++ program
    should be at most 80 characters. (I usually limit to 79 characters.)
\li All outputs must match exactly the output shown. 
    That includes every single space and every blank line.

\li The format of your program must look like this
(replacing \lq\lq John Doe'' with your name of course!):
\end{enumerate}
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
// File: a01q01.cpp
// Name: smaug

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    *** YOUR WORK HERE ***

    return 0;
}
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[] In particular:
\begin{enumerate}
\li You must have your name and the name of the file at the top of each 
    \cpp\ source file as shown above.
\li Your \cpp\ source file must end with a blank line.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

Read the questions carefully before diving in!
