Now complete the
{\small
\begin{console}
void move_south(Robot & robot);
\end{console}
}
function.

Note that all test code from Q1 and Q2 must be retained.
In other words, Q3 builds on top of Q2.
The test option here is 3.
From Q2, you should be able to tell what the
\verb!move_south! function should achieve.
