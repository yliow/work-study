\textsc{Seeding the random number generator}

The random number generator is used.
To make the behavior more deterministic, your program must allow the
user to choose the random seed (instead of using
\verb!time()!), i.e., your main program
must start with this:

\begin{console}[frame=single]
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

int main()
{
    int seed;
    std::cin >> seed;
    srand(seed);

    // The rest of your code ...
    
    return 0;
}
\end{console}

Whenever you run the program,
the first line of your console would then look
like this:
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\underline{42}
...
\end{console}
assuming you choose \verb!42! as the seed for the random generator.
If you choose 1 as the seed, then the console window would look like
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\underline{1}
...
\end{console}

To save on paper and ink, in the following,
I will not include the first line of the console
window whenever I display an execution of the program.
