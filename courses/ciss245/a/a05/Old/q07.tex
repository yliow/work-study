\textsc{Skeleton code for world}

Although we do have all the positions of the robots in the robots themselves,
it is still convenient to have all the locations marks in some kind of a 
\lq\lq map''.
I'll call this array variable \verb!world!.
For instance it's useful for drawing purposes.
We'll use a 2-dimensional array.
