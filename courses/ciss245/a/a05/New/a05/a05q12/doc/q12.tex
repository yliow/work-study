I have given you enough. 
I did not give you implementation details on the pot of gold.
But you have enough to figure it out on your own.
(There are many ways to implement the pot of gold. It
does not matter how you choose to do it. Just get it done.)

Now complete the problem.
As much as possible, you should use functions available.

The general pseudocode in the main program looks like this:
\begin{console}
build world (including the walls)
create power stations
put power stations at random positions in the world
build robots (three of them with names c, d, r)
put robots at randomly chosen available positions in the world
set time to 100

while time > 0:

    if any robot has found the gold:
        break

    move each robot randomly by one step to an available unoccupied
    position

    for each power station, check which robot(s) are just next to it
    and transfer energy to robot(s) according to the above given rules

    decrement time
\end{console}

(There's no fighting among the robots!)

You are strongly encouraged to add your own functions to the
various files to make your code readable.

(Note: \verb!r! = r2d2, \verb!c! = c3p0, \verb!d! = Darth Vader. 
Darth Vader is sort of like a robot ... yes? no?)
