\textsc{Test code}

You are now on your own:
you should design a complete test like previous assignments.
Desiging test cases and trying to break your code (or someone else's)
is an extremely important discipline.

For instance when you run your \verb!main()! (in \verb!testLongInt.cpp!)
the user enters option 0 to test the constructor that accepts an int
and prints the LongInt constructor with the int,
the user enters option 1 to test the constructor that accepts a
C-string and prints the LongInt constructor with the C-string, etc.
Also, see section on \textsc{Ultimate test cases}.

Temporarily, you can use the following ad-hoc and incomplete test code.
The test code is incomplete; you should add code to test all methods/functions 
to this code. The \verb!multeq_digit()! method multiplies a 
digit to the object. The \verb!multeq_tenpower()! multiplies a 
tenpower to object. For instance if a is \verb!LongInt(123)!, 
then \verb!a.multieq_digit(2)! will make \verb!a! the same as 
\verb!LongInt(246)! and \verb!a.multeq_tenpower(4)! will make 
a the same as \verb!LongInt(1230000)!.
