\textsc{Objectives}     
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
        \item Design a class with supporting methods and functions
        \item Design a class with object composition
        \item Declare objects
        \item Access member variables of an object
        \item Write member functions/operators
        \item Overload operators
        \item Translate algorithms to code
    \end{enumerate}

As always read the whole document carefully before diving into coding.
While many previous assignments are practice on syntax, this one
requires problem solving.
Start early ... and be careful.
