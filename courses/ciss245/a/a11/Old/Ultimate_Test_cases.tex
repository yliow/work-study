\textsc{Ultimate test cases}

Finally add the following tests to your \verb!main()!:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item If the user enters test option 100,
your program accepts $n$ from the
user and then computes and prints $n!$ (factorial of $n$).
You should test your program by printing the factorial of 1000 and
factorial of 5000.
You can save your computation like this:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,fontsize=\footnotesize]
./a.out > factorial5000.txt
\end{Verbatim}
You are strongly encouraged to check your computation with others in the
class. For instance how many right-trailing zeroes are there in your
$1000!$? What is the 200-th digit of $5000!$? Etc. 
\item If the user enters test option 101,
your accepts $n$ from the
user and prints the prime factorization of $n$.
If you enter $6$ for $n$, the output is in this format
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,fontsize=\footnotesize]
2 3
\end{Verbatim}
i.e., print the primes in accending order.
If you enter 20, the output is
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,fontsize=\footnotesize]
2 2 5
\end{Verbatim}
You should test by factoring $3224380470287$.
\end{enumerate}
