Q3.
\textsc{The Fib3 Class: A Static Table Lookup}

Obviously there's no reason for keeping different tables in different \texttt{Fib2} objects:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
Fib2 fib2a;
std::cout << fib2a(5) << "\n"; // fib2a has a table

Fib2 fib2b;
std::cout << fib2b(5) << "\n"; // fib2b has a table too -- not cool!!!
\end{Verbatim}

Now:
\begin{tightlist}
  \li make the table member static so that they both share the same table. Run your test code to
  make sure that you haven't broken anything while making the changes. Think of a way of
  initializing \verb!table!
  \li Provide a static method, \texttt{lookup()} so that \texttt{Fib3::lookup(n)} returns the value of
  \verb!table[n]!.
\end{tightlist}

Here's the test code:
