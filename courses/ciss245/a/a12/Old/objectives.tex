\textsc{Objectives}
  \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \li Overload and use \texttt{operator()}; function objects. 
    \li Write and use static instance variables (i.e., static member variables).
    \li Write and use static methods (i.e., static member functions).
    \li Prevent object construction by clients by making constructors private.
    \li Include objects as instance variables.
    \li Create names with external linkages; \verb!extern!.
  \end{enumerate}

This assignment involves several major ideas: \texttt{operator()},
static members and methods, and
objects as instance variables.
You will also prevent clients from constructing objects by
making constructors private (this might seem bizarre, but you'll
see why you want to do this by the end of this assignment).
