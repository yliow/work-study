# To set up links through Liow's pdfs to create solutions ...
first go into superuser mode

type in: ln -s /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/solutions.py /usr/local/bin/solutions

now the command 'solutions' will work when wanting to link an exercise with it's solutions in Latex.

for example, in directory notes, make a directory named exercises, go into this directory and execute 'solutions make-ex example-0'

cut the exercise from the tex file in the notes directory, and paste it into exercises/example-0/question.tex

this will create a directory for example-0, now in the tex file of where this exercise is, do input{exercises/example-0/main.tex} so a link will be created
