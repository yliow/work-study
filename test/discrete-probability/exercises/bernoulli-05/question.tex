You have decided to set up a game table 
as a fund raising event
for the CS club.
To play the game, a player has to pay you \$1.
After paying you \$1, he/she will roll a die $n=7$ times.
If he/she gets at least 2 sixes, he/she will get \$100.
Of course you want to make money (duh) -- what kind of fund raising event
wants to lose money??
So you have decided to lower the chance of the player
getting at least $k=2$ sixes in $n=7$ rolls.
You found a 3D printer and a program that will allow you to
build a loaded die.
What is the lowest
probability to use if you want to break even?
(Of course you do want to raise some money.
If you make it impossible to get a six, then after just a couple of
games, people would know that the die is rigged.
So you want to know your break even point and then slightly lower
the probability of getting a six.)
