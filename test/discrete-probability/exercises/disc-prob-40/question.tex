  Continuing the example above,
  how many neighboring inversions
  are there?
  A \defone{neighboring inversion} is an inversion
  next to each other.
  For example if you look at the permutation $(4,2,1,3)$,
  you see the $4,2$
  is a neighboring inversion because they
  are next to each other in the permutation
  \[
    (\underline{4,2},1,3)
  \]
  (I'm talking about the index
  positions, not the value).
  However $4,1$ is an inversion but not
  a neighboring inversion:
  \[
    (\underline{4},2,\underline{1},3)
  \]
  Write a program to test your
  conclusion.
