  You have $N$ decks of cards.
  Each deck of cards contain $n$ distinct cards -- you can think of them as being numbered
  $0$, $1$, $2$, ..., $n-1$.
  You randomly shuffle the decks as much as you like.
  After you shuffled,
  how many decks
  have their cards in their original position except for exactly two.
  For $n = 10$, here's an example
  where all cards are in their original positions exactly for two:
  $(0,1,\underline{4},3,\underline{2},5,6,7,8,9)$.
