Suppose you have an array of size 5 which is a permutation of 0..4, say
\verb!x = [3,2,1,0]!.
For each $i = 0, 1, 2, 3$, put $x[i]$ into its right place by
swapping it with the value occupying where $x[i]$ should be.
For instance $x[0] = 3$, so $x[0]$ should go into index 3 location.
Therefore you swap $x[0]$ and $x[3]$.
This gives you
\verb!x = [0,2,1,3]!.
For index $ = 1$, you get this:
\verb!x = [0,1,2,3]!.
For $i = 2$, there's no change.
For $i = 3$, there's no change.
