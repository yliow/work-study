  Modify the counting sort algorithm to sort a huge array of \verb!double!s
  where there is a (known) small number of distinct \verb!double! values in the 
  array.
  Say the size of the array is $10^6$ and there are at most $1000$ distinct
  \verb!double!s in the array.
  What if the values are not known ahead of time?
  (The idea should also work for other types.)
