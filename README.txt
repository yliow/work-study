2024/04/11: In some latex file near the top the following

\begin{python0}
  from solutions import *; clear()
\end{python0}

should be

\begin{python0}
from solutions import *; clear()
\end{python0}

i.e., no indentation for the python code.

2024/04/11: Each file has one section. There are several section in closure.tex.
For instance the "Closure: Intersection" section is inside closure.tex. Move
the "Closure: Intersection" content into a separate file named
"closure-intersection.tex". Etc. The table of contents will tell you which one
has to be moved out since every section in the table of contents will have
it's own "debug: [filename]" message.
