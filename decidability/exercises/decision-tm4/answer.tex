Assume that $\Null_\TM$ is decidable, say it is decided by $D$.

Construct a TM $A$ that does this:
Let $\langle M \rangle \# \langle w \rangle$ be an input for $A$.
\begin{tightlist}
  \item $A$ construct a TM $M'$ (which depends on $M$ and $w$)
  which does the following:
  When $M'$ executes, it replaced the input with $w$,
  and then proceeds to
  work exactly like $M$.
  Note that if we run $M'$ on $\ep$, then it would be the
  same as running $M$ on $w$.
  Of course when I say $A$ \lq\lq constructs'' $M'$, I  mean $A$ write
  the encoding, $\langle M'\rangle$ somewhere on its tape.
  \item
  $A$ then simulates $D$ on $\langle M' \rangle$.
  Note that $D$ is decidable therefore $D$ must either accept or reject
  ($D$ cannot run forever).
  This means that as $A$ simulates $D$ one step at a time
  $A$ will at some point in time see $D$ entering the
  accept or the reject state.
  \item If while $A$ is simulating $D$ running on $\langle M'\rangle$,
  $A$ sees that $D$ accepts $\langle M' \rangle$ (i.e., 
  $M'$ accepts $\ep$, which means that $M$ accepts $w$), then
  $A$ enters its accept state.
  \item If while $A$ is simulating $D$ running on $\langle M'\rangle$,
  $A$ sees that $D$ rejects $\langle M' \rangle$ (i.e., 
  $M'$ does not accepts $\ep$, which means that $M$ does not
  accepts $w$), then
  $A$ enters its reject state.
  \end{tightlist}
We have shown that
\[
\ACCEPT_\TM \leq \Null_\TM
\]
This means that $A$ is a decider for $\ACCEPT_\TM$ which is a contradiction.
Therefore $\Null_\TM$ cannot be a decidable language.
