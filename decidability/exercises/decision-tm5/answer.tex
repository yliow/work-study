Yes.
Depending on the way TMs are encoded,
design a TM, $D$, such that when $D$ is given $\langle M \rangle$,
$D$ moves the
read-write head to
the section of $\langle M \rangle$ that encodes the set of states
and begin counting the number of states.
If the counting stops before 42, $D$ rejects.
If the counting goes up to 43, $D$ rejects.
Otherwise $D$ accepts.
