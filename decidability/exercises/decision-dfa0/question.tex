  Decision problems for DFAs.
  It's not too surprising that DFAs can also be encoded.
  Therefore one can ask if it's possible to construct TM or deciders
  to accept DFA encodings (possibly also with encoded  inputs) to
  solve certain problems.
  Are the following problems decidable?
  This means \lq\lq can you find a decider for the given problems.?''
  \begin{tightlist}
    \item Given a DFA $M$, is $L(M) = \{\}$?
    (This is $\EMPTY_\DFA$).
    \item Given a DFA $M$, is $L(M) = \Sigma^*$? ($\Sigma$ is the
    input alphabet of $M$).
    \item Given a DFA $M$, is $\ep \in L(M)$?
    \item Given a DFA $M$, is $L(M)$ infinite?
    \item Given a DFA $M$, is $L(M)$ finite? (What I you are given $M$ and $n$
      and the question is to decide is $|L(M)| = n$?)
    \item Given a DFA $M$ and input $w$ (for $M$), is $w$ in $L(M)$?
    (This is the acceptance problem for DFAs)
    \item Given a DFA $M$ and input $w$ (for $M$), does $M$ halt when
    it runs on input $w$?
    (This is the halting problem for DFAs.)
    \item Given two DFAs $M, M'$, is $L(M)$ the same as $L(M')$?
  \end{tightlist}
