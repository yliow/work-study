Is the following language decidable:
\[
\mathsc{Regular}_\TM
\tinysidebar{$\mathsc{Regular}_\TM$}\index{regular$\mathsc{Regular}_\TM$}
=
\{
\langle M \rangle
\,|\, \exists DFA M' \text{ such that } L(M') =  L(M)
\}
\]
This is the problem of determining if a Turing machine
accepts the same language as a DFA, i.e., the problem of
determining if the language of a Turing machine is regular.
