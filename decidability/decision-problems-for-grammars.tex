\begin{ex}
  Decision problems for CFLs.
  Are the following problems decidable?
  \begin{tightlist}
    \item Given a CFG $G$, is $L(G) = \{\}$?
    \item Given a CFG $G$, is $L(G) = \Sigma^*$? ($\Sigma$ is the
    set of terminals of $G$).
    \item Given a CFG $G$, is $\ep \in L(G)$?
    \item Given a CFG $G$, is $L(G)$ infinite?
    \item Given a CFG $G$, is $L(G)$ finite?
    \item Given a CFG $G$ and string $w$ (of terminals of $G$),
    is $w$ in $L(G)$?
    \item Given two CFGs $G, G'$, is $L(G)$ the same as $L(G')$?
  \end{tightlist}
