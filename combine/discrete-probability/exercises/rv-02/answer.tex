Let $S = \{\HEAD, \TAIL\}$ and $p(\HEAD) = p(\TAIL) = 1/2$.
Let $X(\HEAD) = 0, X(\TAIL) = 1$ and $Y = X$.
Then
\[
\E[XY] = \sum_{x \in S} (XY)(x) p(x) = 1/2
\]
and
\[
\E[X] \cdot \E[Y]
= \E[X]^2
= \left( \sum_{x \in S} X(x) p(x) \right)^2
= 1/4
\]
Therefore $\E[XY] \neq \E[X] \cdot \E[Y]$ in general.
