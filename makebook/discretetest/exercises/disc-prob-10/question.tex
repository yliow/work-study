Suppose in a book, you read:
\lq\lq Consider a random experiment of rolling two fair dice.
The probability that the first die is even is 1/2
and the probability that the second die is odd (i.e., one, three, or five) is 1/2.
Therefore the probability that the first is
even and the second is odd is $(1/2)\cdot(1/2)$ = $1/4$."
Let
$p_0 : S_0 \rightarrow [0,1]$
denote the pdf of the random experiment of rolling only
the first die.
Let
$p_1 : S_1 \rightarrow [0,1]$
denote the pdf of the random experiment of rolling only
the second die.
Let $p : S \rightarrow [0,1]$ be the pdf of the pdf of
random experiment of rolling the first and then the second die. 
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the sample space $S$?
\item What is the value $p(r_0, r_1)$?
\item What is the event $A$ of \lq\lq the first roll is even" in the random experiment of rolling twi dice?
\item What is the event $B$ of \lq\lq the second roll is odd" in the random experiment of rolling twi dice?
\item Prove formally that $A$ and $B$ are independent.
\item What is the value $p$ in terms of $p_0$ and $p_1$?
  \qed
\end{itemize}
