\section{Formal Definition of big-O}

Here's the big-O definition again:

Let $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ be two functions of $n$.
We write
\[ f \in O(g) \]
and say \lq\lq $f(n)$ is big-O of $g(n)$ if
\[
\text{there exist $C$ and $N$ such that $|f(n)| \leq C|g(n)|$ 
for $n \geq N$}
\]

So far I've been using graphs to give you an understanding of the 
big-O definition.
However the clause
\[
\text{ ... for $n \geq N$}
\]
requires us to say something about arbitrarily large values for $n$
and of course we can't draw infinitely large graphs.

Now I'm going to use math to show $f(n) = O(g(n))$.
Occasionally I'll be using graphs as a tool to help.
But hard facts must be proven by math.

Let's do some examples.
