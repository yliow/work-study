What is asymptotic analysis? 
It is the study of growth behavior of
 functions as the independent variable gets larger and larger.

(More generally, there can be more than one independent variable
and the limit(s) can be other than infinity).

It's a kind of math tool that allows you to say
\begin{longtable}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{informally} & \text{notation} \\
\hline
\text{$f(n)$ \lq\lq is roughly $\leq$" $g(n)$ for large $n$} & \text{$f(n) = O(g(n))$} \\
\text{$f(n)$ \lq\lq is roughly $\geq$" $g(n)$ for large $n$} & \text{$f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$} \\
\text{$f(n)$ \lq\lq is roughly $=$" $g(n)$ for large $n$}    & \text{$f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$} \\
\hline
\end{longtable}
%Here's a cheat sheet:
%\begin{align*}
%\lq\lq \leq " &\,\,\, ... \,\,\, \text{big-O} \\
%\lq\lq \geq " &\,\,\, ... \,\,\, \text{big-$\Omega$} \\
%\lq\lq  = "   &\,\,\, ... \,\,\, \text{big-$\Theta$}
%\end{align*}
I'll get more specific later.
The big picture to keep in mind is that
the asymptotic notation is a notation for comparing functions.

I'm going to use this tool to measure various things about algorithms, 
including their runtime and resource usage such as memory usage.
I'll start with big-O.
Once you get the hang of big-O, the big-$\Omega$ and big-$\Theta$ is easy.
