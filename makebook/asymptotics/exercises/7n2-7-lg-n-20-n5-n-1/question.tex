Let
\[
f(n) = 7n^{2.7} \lg n + \frac{n^5}{n^2 + 1}
\]
Using plots, find the smallest integer $k$ such that $f(n) = O(n^k)$.
Supply a $C$ and an $N$ such that 
\[
|f(n)| \leq C |g(n)|
\]
for $n \geq N$.
(Note: $\lg = \log_2$. For the study of algorithms log-base-2 is more common than base 10 and base $e$.)
