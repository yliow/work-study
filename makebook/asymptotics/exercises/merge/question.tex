  Write a merge function.
  For instance \verb!merge(u, v, w)! where
  \verb!u!, \verb!v!, \verb!w! are \verb!std::vector< int >!
  objects, and \verb!u,v! are sorted, and you want to merge \verb!u,v! into \verb!w!. This means that \verb!w! has all the values in \verb!u! and \verb!v!
  and \verb!w! is sorted.
