The following algorithms performs some kind of shuffling
on an array \verb!x! of size \verb!n!:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, fontsize=\footnotesize]
seed(0)
for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n * n - 1:
    j = rand() % n
    k = rand() % n
    if j is not k:
        t = x[j]
        x[j] = x[i]
        x[i] = t
\end{Verbatim}
The basic idea is very simple: Pick two indices and swap the values
at those indices if the indices are different. Repeat.
\begin{enumerate}[nosep,label=(\alph*)]
\item
  Rewrite the above with goto statements.
  Assume that each line requires constant time.
  Assign times to each statement.
\item
  Compute the big-O of the best runtime. 
\item
  Compute the big-O of the worst runtime.
\item
  Under the assumption that 1/4 of the iterations
  of the for-loop has a boolean value of FALSE for the boolean expression
  in the if-statement:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, fontsize=\footnotesize]
    if j is not k:
\end{Verbatim}
  compute the average runtime.
\item
  Under the assumption that $1/n$ of the iterations
  of the for-loop has a boolean value of FALSE for the boolean expression
  in the if-statement:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, fontsize=\footnotesize]
    if j is not k:
\end{Verbatim}
compute the average runtime.
\end{enumerate}
