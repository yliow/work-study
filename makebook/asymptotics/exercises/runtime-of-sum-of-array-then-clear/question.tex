The following pseudocode is similar to the above.
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, fontsize=\small]
s = 0
for i = 0, ..., n - 1:
    s = s + x[i]

for i = 0, ..., n - 1:
    x[i] = 0
\end{Verbatim}
(a) Rewrite the above algorithm with
goto statements, assign constant times to each statement and 
compute the time taken as a function of $n$, $t_1$, ....

(b) Simplify the runtime function by giving names $A$, $B$, ...
to the constants of the function from (a).

(c) Fudge away the constants and write down the simplest $g(n)$ such 
that the time in (b) is a big-O of your $g(n)$.
Your $g(n)$ should be either $n$ or $n^2$ or $n^3$ or ...

(d) What is the space complexity of the algorithm?
