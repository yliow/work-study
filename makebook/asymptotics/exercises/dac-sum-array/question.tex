Using the same idea as above, write a \verb!sum! function
that accepts an array (of integers, say) and recursively
splits the array into two, calls the sum function, and return the 
sum of the return values.
The base case is when the array is empty in which case you return 0
or when the array has one value in which case you return that value.
Test your code.
What do you think is the runtime?
