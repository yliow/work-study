Given an $n$--by--$n$ 2D array,
the main (or first) diagonal are the entries at
index
$(0,0),
(1,1),
(2,2),...(n-1,n-1)$.
The second diagonal are the entries at
$(0, 1),
(1, 2),
(2, 3), ...
(n-2, n-1)$.
The third diagonal are the entries at
$(0, 2),
(1, 3),
(2, 4), ...
(n-3, n-1)$.
Etc.
The above are $n$ diagonals.
Write a program that stores the sum of first diagonal,
sum of second diagonal,
sum of third diagonal, etc. of array \verb!x!
into another array \verb!y!.
What is the runtime?
