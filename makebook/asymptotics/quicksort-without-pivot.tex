\section{Quicksort without pivot}

Maintain left and right subarrays so that max of left is $\leq$
min of right.
Need running largest 2 values in left and largest 2 values in right.

To prevent recursion: maintain is ascending for left
and is descending on right.
If is ascending on left -- do not recurse on left.
If is descending on right --  do not recurse on right.
So this partition method returns either a pivot index or
-1 for do not recurse left,
-2 for do not recurse right,
-3 for do not recurse both left and right.

How about also ensuring the max value of the left is at the largest index
in left
and the minimum of right is at the smallest index in right?
Like insertion sort.
This implies that when the partition ends, the max of left
and min of right is in their correct places.
