\section{Summation}

I'm going to compute the runtime of the bubblesort very soon.
Before I do that I'm going to give you the formula for the arithmetic sum
which will be helpful in runtime computations:
\[
1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
In fact sums are common in this game.
So I'm going to use the summation notation to simplify the computation.

Let $a_i$ be a formula in $i$.
The notation
\[
\sum_{i = 3}^7 a_i
\]
is a shorthand notation for 
\[
\sum_{i = 3}^7 a_i = a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7
\]

For instance
\[
\sum_{i = 3}^7 i^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2
\]

\begin{ex}
Compute the value of $\sum_{i = 2}^5 i^2$
\qed
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Compute the value of $\sum_{i = 0}^4 (2i)$
\qed
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Compute the value of $\sum_{i = 0}^4 (2i + 1)$
\qed
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Compute $\sum_{i = 2}^5 i^2$
\qed
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Compute $\sum_{i = 2}^{10} 1$
\qed
\end{ex}

\begin{ex} \mbox{}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Write down the following as a sum of terms without simplifying:
\[
\sum_{i = 2}^5 (5i^2)
\]
\item[(b)] Now write down the following by writing down the product of 5 and a
sum of terms. Do not simplify. 
\[
5 \sum_{i = 2}^5 i^2
\]
\end{itemize}
Check that the expressions in (a) and (b) are the same.
\qed 
\end{ex}

Do you see that in general
\[
\
\sum_{i = 1}^n c a_i 
= 
c\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i 
\]

\begin{ex} \mbox{}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Write down the following as a sum of terms without simplifying:
\[
\sum_{i=2}^5 (i^2 + \sqrt{i})
\]
\item[(b)] Now write down the following by expanding each
summation into two sums of terms. Do not simplify. 
\[
\sum_{i=2}^5 i^2 + \sum_{i=2}^5 \sqrt{i}
\]
\end{itemize}
Check that the expressions in (a) and (b) are the same.
\qed 
\end{ex}

It's not too surprising that in general
\[
\
\sum_{i = 1}^n (a_i + b_i) 
= 
\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i + \sum_{i=1}^n b_i 
\]

Let me summarize the basic summmation formulas here so that you can refer
to them:

\begin{thm} \mbox{}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
$\sum_{i = 1}^n c a_i = c\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i $
\item[(b)]
$\sum_{i = 1}^n (a_i + b_i) = \sum_{i = 1}^n a_i + \sum_{i=1}^n b_i $
\item[(c)]
$\sum_{i = 1}^n (ca_i + db_i) = c\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i + d\sum_{i=1}^n b_i $
\end{itemize}
Of course the above formulas hold when the lower limit of the summation
are all changed to another value.
For instance
\[
\sum_{i = 5}^n c a_i = c\sum_{i = 5}^n a_i
\]
In general:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
$\sum_{i=m}^n c a_i = c\sum_{i=m}^n a_i $
\item[(b)]
$\sum_{i=m}^n (a_i + b_i) = \sum_{i=m}^n a_i + \sum_{i=m}^n b_i $
\item[(c)]
$\sum_{i=m}^n (ca_i + db_i) = c\sum_{i=m}^n a_i + d\sum_{i=m}^n b_i $
\end{itemize}
\end{thm}


\begin{ex}
Compute
$\sum_{i=0}^5 \left( \sum_{j=0}^7 i(i-1)j \right)$
\qed
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Compute
$\sum_{i=0}^5 \left( \sum_{j=i}^7 i(i-1)j \right)$
\qed
\end{ex}

The following \lq\lq splitting out terms from the bottom'' is obviously true:
\[
\sum_{i = 0}^{10} a_i = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \sum_{i = 2}^{10} a_i
\]
So is \lq\lq splitting out terms from the top'':
\[
\sum_{i = 0}^{10} a_i = \sum_{i = 0}^{8} a_i + a_9 + a_{10} 
\]
Likewise you can split a summation into two like this:
\[
\sum_{i = 0}^{10} a_i = \sum_{i=0}^2 a_i + \sum_{i=3}^{10} a_i
\]

\begin{ex}
You are given 
\[
\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i = 42 \,\,\,\,\, \text{ and } \,\,\,\,\, 
\sum_{i = 1}^n b_i = 60
\]
Compute
\[
\sum_{i = 1}^n (2a_i + 3b_i)
\]
\qed
\end{ex}


\begin{ex}
You are given $\sum_{i=1}^{11} a_i = 120$,
$\sum_{i=11}^{20} a_i = 42$, and $\sum_{i=1}^{20} a_i = 691$.
What can you tell me about $a_{11}$?
\qed
\end{ex}
