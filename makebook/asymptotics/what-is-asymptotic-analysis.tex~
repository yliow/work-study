\section{What is Asymptotic Analysis?}

What is asymptotic analysis? 
It is the study of growth behavior of
 functions as the independent variable approaches
infinity.

(More generally, there can be more than one independent variable
and the limit(s) can be other than infinity).

It's a kind of math tool that allows you say
\[
f(n) \text{ is roughly $\leq$ to } g(n) \text{ for large values of $n$}
\]
or 
\[
f(n) \text{ is roughly $\geq$ to } g(n) \text{ for large values of $n$}
\]
or 
\[
f(n) \text{ is roughly $=$ to } g(n) \text{ for large values of $n$}
\]

I'll get more specific later.
The big picture to keep in mind is that it's a way to compare functions.

I'm going to use this tool to measure various things about algorithms, 
including their runtime and resource usage such as memory usage.
