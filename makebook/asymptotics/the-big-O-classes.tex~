\section{The big-O Classes}

The following are some big-O asymptotic classes:
\[
O(1) \subset
O(n) \subset
O(n^2) \subset
O(n^3) \subset \cdots
\]
Every polynomial is of one of the above complexity classes.
For instance 
\[
f(n) = 5n^3 - 100n^2 + \frac{1}{2}n + 23 = O(n^3)
\]
Of course this $f(n)$ is also $O(n^r)$ for $r > 3$.

You might have a function that looks like this:
\[
f(n) = 7n^{2.7} + 5n + 1
\]
i.e., the powers need not be integers.
In this case
\[
f(n) = 7n^{2.7} + 5n + 1 = O(n^{2.7})
\]
since $n^2.7$ grows faster that $n$.

In general if $1 \leq r < s$, then
\[
O(n^r) \subset O(n^s)
\]

Note that the inclusion is strict, i.e., 
\[
O(n^r) \neq O(n^s)
\]
in other words there is a function $f(n)$ in $O(n^s)$ that is not in 
$O(n^r)$.
