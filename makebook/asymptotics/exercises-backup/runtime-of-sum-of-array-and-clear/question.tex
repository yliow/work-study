The following  sums up all the values in array $x$ of size $n$ and sets
the values of the array to 0:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, fontsize=\small]
s = 0
for i = 0, ..., n - 1:
    s = s + x[i]
    x[i] = 0
\end{Verbatim}
Assume each of the statements
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, fontsize=\small]
    s = s + x[i]
    x[i] = 0
\end{Verbatim}
take constant time.
Here's the algorithm with goto statements:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, fontsize=\small]
         s = 0
         i = 0 
LOOP:    if i >= n:         
             goto ENDLOOP          
         s = s + x[i]
         x[i] = 0
         i = i + 1          
         goto LOOP
ENDLOOP:
\end{Verbatim}
(a) Assign constant times to each statement and 
compute the time taken as a function of $n$, $t_1$, ....

(b) Simplify the runtime function by giving names $A$, $B$, ...
to the constants of the function from (a).

(c) Fudge away the constants and write down the simplest $g(n)$ such 
that the time in (b) is a big-$O$ of your $g(n)$.
Your $g(n)$ should be either $n$ or $n^2$ or $n^3$ or ...

(d) What is the space complexity of the algorithm?
