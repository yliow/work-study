\section{Longest Common Substring}
 

Suppose you're given an array \verb!x! and you're interested in finding 
the two longest common subarray.
For instance in the following array
\begin{common}
x = [3,4,3,2,5,2,1,2,3,4,2,3,8]
\end{common}
you see that \verb![4,3,2]! appear twice:
\begin{common}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
x = [3,\underline{4,3,2},5,2,1,2,3,\underline{4,2,3},8]
\end{common}
