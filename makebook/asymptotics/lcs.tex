\section{Longest Common Substring/Subarray}
 

Suppose you're given an array \verb!x! and you're interested in finding 
the two longest common subarray.
For instance in the following array
\begin{console}
x = [3,4,3,2,5,2,1,2,3,4,2,3,8]
\end{console}
you see that \verb![4,3,2]! appear twice:
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
x = [3,\underline{4,3,2},5,2,1,2,3,\underline{4,2,3},8]
\end{console}

You can of course make a list of all possible subarrays with
the starting index positions and then compare them.
For instance
\begin{console}
...
4, [5]
4, [5,2]
...
\end{console}
shows that starting at index 4, you have an an array \verb![5]!
and at index 4, you have an array \verb![5,2]!.

I'm going to denote \verb!x[i,n]! to denote the array
with that starts at index \verb!i! and of length \verb!n!.


\begin{console}
  3 4 3 2 5 2 1 2 3 4 2 3 8
 +-------------------------
3|1   1           1     1
4|  2               1
3|
2|
5|

\end{console}
