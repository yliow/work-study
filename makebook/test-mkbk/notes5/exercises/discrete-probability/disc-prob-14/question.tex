  Take the derivative (wrt $x$) for the equation in the previous exercise
  and your $f(x)$ will satisfy a differential equation of the form:
  \[
    y' + p(x) y = q(x) y^n
  \]
  where the right is (fortunately) simple: it's $q(x)$ instead of $q(x)y^n$, i.e., $n = 0$.
  The above is called a Bernoulli's differential equation.
