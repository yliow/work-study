  Consider the random experiment of rolling two dice.
  The sample space is $S = S_1 \times S_2$ where
  $S_i = \{\ONE, \TWO, \ldots, \SIX \}$ ($i = 0, 1$).
  For instance $(\ONE, \TWO) \in S$ is the outcome that the first
  die is $\ONE$ and the second die is $\TWO$.
  The probability is uniform.
  Let $X_1((s_1, s_2)) = s_1$ and $X_2((s_1, s_2)) = s_2$.
  \begin{myenum}
    \li
    What is the probability of getting a sum of 6 if
    one of the die is less than 3?
    Before you compute that using intuition, I want
    you to write it down using a conditional probability,
    possibly with extra random variables.
    \li
    Now do the same for 
    the probability of getting a sum of 3 if
    one of the die is less than 6.
  \end{myenum}
