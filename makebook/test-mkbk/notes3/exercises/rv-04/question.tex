  Let \verb!x[0..9]! be an array containing a random
  permutation of $0,1,2,...,9$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \li
    What is the probability that \verb!x[0]! is \verb!0!?
    Write a \cpp\ program to perform a random experiment
    to prove
    what you just said.
    Can you prove what you just said?
    \li 
    Let \verb!i! be an integer in \verb![0, 9]!.
    What is the probability that \verb!x[i]! is \verb!i!?
    Write a \cpp\ program to perform a random experiment
    to verify what you just said.
    Can you prove what you just said.
    \li 
    Let \verb!i! and \verb!j! be two distinct integers
    in \verb![0, 9]!.
    What is the probability that \verb!x[i]! is \verb!i!
    and \verb!x[j]! is \verb!j!?
    Write a \cpp\ program to perform a random experiment
    to verify what you just said.
    Now prove what you just said.
    \li 
    What is average number of \verb!i! such that 
    \verb!x[i]! is \verb!i!?
    Write a \cpp\ program to perform a random experiment
    to verify what you just said.
    Can you prove what you just said?
  \end{itemize}
