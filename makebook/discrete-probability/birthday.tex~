\section{The Birthday Paradox}


How many people do you need in order to have at least a pair with
the same birthday/
There are about 365.25 days in a day.
So you would think that you need maybe about half.
But surprisingly, you actually need a very small group of randomly
chosen people in order to have a change where at least one pair
has a common birthday.

Since I'm trying to prove that a very small number is enough,
let's round up and say that there are 366 days in a year.

\subsection{Method: probability computation}

It's easier to ask the opposite question first.
Let $n$ be the number of people you have chosen.
What is the probability that there is \textit{no} two with the same
birthday?

That sounds kind of difficult.
So let's make things concrete,
What if $n = 1$? 
Well ... there's no way for a pair to have the same birthday!
Because there's only one person!
Duh!

OK.
What if there are two?
In other words, what if $n = 2$?
Suppose the birthday of the first person is known.
Then in order for the second person not to have the same birthday
as the first, the second person has a \lq\lq choice'' of birthday
among 366 - 1 days out of 366 days.
So in this case, the probability is
\[
\frac{366 - 1}{366}
\]

Now what if $n = 3$?
Suppose there are 3 people.
After the first person has announced his/her birthday,
then the probability that the second person has a different birthday as
the first must be 
\[
\frac{366 - 1}{366}
\]
After that since two birthdays are taken, the probability for the third
person to have a birthday different from the first two must be 
\[
\frac{366 - 2}{366}
\]
Altogether, the probability that among 3 randomly chosen people not to have
the same birthday must be 
\[
\frac{366 - 1}{366} \cdot 
\frac{366 - 2}{366}
\]

In general, you see quickly that if you have $n$ people, the probability
that they all have different birthdays must be 
\[
\frac{366 - 1}{366} \cdot 
\frac{366 - 2}{366} \cdot \cdots \cdot
\frac{366 - (n - 1)}{366}
\]
Of course the probability of have at least a pair with the same
birthday is then
\[
1 - \frac{366 - 1}{366} \cdot 
\frac{366 - 2}{366} \cdot \cdots \cdot
\frac{366 - (n - 1)}{366}
\]

Now what do I mean by a \textit{good}? 
Let's say by that I mean the probability is greater than 0.5.
So I want to find $n$ such that
\[
1 - \frac{366 - 1}{366} \cdot 
\frac{366 - 2}{366} \cdot \cdots \cdot
\frac{366 - (n - 1)}{366} > 0.5
\]
We can find $n$ by running the following program:
\begin{console}
def f(i): 
    return (366 - i) / 366.0

def prob(n):
    p = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        p *= f(i)
    return 1 - p

for n in range(1, 40):
    print n, prob(n)
\end{console}
Here's the output:
\begin{console}
1 0

\end{console}
Looks like we just need 23, which is surprising small!

To verify this, just get a group of 23 people in a room and ask for their
birthdays then there's a strong likelihood that there are two with the same
birthdays.

It's troublesome to get 23 people together.
So let's write a simple program to pick 23 numbers from 1 to 366
and see if there are two with the same value.
\begin{console}
import random; random.seed()
xs = [random.randrange(1, 367) for _ in range(23)]
xs.sort()
print xs
\end{console}
Here's the output running the above several times.
I've done it 7 times.
Go ahead and count the number of times where there is a repeat
birthday:
\begin{console}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
[28, 57, 92, 101, 114, 134, 138, 174, 176, 179, 202, 208, 
218, 231, 239, 241, 251, 253, 283, 286, 294, 317, 325]
[19, 40, 50, 53, 64, 74, 129, 140, 146, 161, 169, 179, 
193, 194, 221, 231, 249, 269, 271, 293, 321, 350, 357]
[14, 36, 43, 55, 83, 124, \underline{133, 133}, 138, 155, 256, 263, 
267, 274, 283, 296, 307, 315, 325, 338, 348, 349, 355]
[4, 41, 44, 80, 119, 124, 136, 139, 140, 163, 183, 212, 
215, 216, 217, 228, 235, 248, 256, 263, 271, 281, 350]
[25, 28, 67, 91, 120, 146, \underline{152, 152}, 196, 206, 222, \underline{223,} 
\underline{223}, 234, 240, 242, 248, 253, 288, 289, 314, 320, 352]
[20, 21, 55, 76, 91, 102, 104, 119, 144, 152, 173, 200, 
204, 206, 214, 222, 230, \underline{249, 249}, 326, 334, 354, 360]
[24, 30, 35, 50, 62, 66, 77, 78, \underline{91, 91}, 121, 150, 153, 
183, 184, \underline{211, 211}, 220, 235, 262, 344, 347, 351]
\end{console}
Now I'm going to do this 10000 times:
\begin{console}
def repeat(xs):
    for i in range(22):
        if xs[i] == xs[i + 1]:
            return True
    return False

import random; random.seed()
count = 0
for i in range(10000):
    xs = [random.randrange(1, 367) for _ in range(23)]
    xs.sort()
    if repeat(xs): 
        count += 1

print count
\end{console}
Here's my output:
\begin{console}
5103
\end{console}
So 5103 out of 10000 simulations have a repeat birthday.
When I ran the experiment with 100000 simulations, the number is 
\begin{console}
50519
\end{console}

Instead of using a program, let's look at the above expression again:
\[
1 - \frac{366 - 1}{366} \cdot 
\frac{366 - 2}{366} \cdot \cdots \cdot
\frac{366 - (n - 1)}{366} > 0.5
\]
This is
\[
1 - 
\left( 1 - \frac{1}{366} \right)  
\left( 1 - \frac{2}{366} \right)  
\cdots 
\left( 1 - \frac{n - 1}{366} \right)
> 0.5  
\]

We want to find the smallest $n$ satifying the above.
You can tell that this is not one of the standard equations
from your math classes.
So let me solve this inequality using a program.
(An approximate using math is below.)
Here's the program:
\begin{python}
s = r'''
n = 2
while 1:
    p = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        p *= (1 - i / 366.0)
    print n, 1 - p
    if 1 - p > 0.5:
         break
    n += 1
'''.strip()
f = file('a15245236.py', 'w')
f.write(s)
f.close()
from latextool_basic import *
print console(s)
print "and the output"
print r'{\small %s}' % shell('python a15245236.py')
\end{python}
  
Now let's derive that using math (and a calculator).
Note that
\begin{align*}
\left( 1 - \frac{1}{366} \right)  
\left( 1 - \frac{2}{366} \right)  
\cdots 
\left( 1 - \frac{n - 1}{366} \right)  
&\leq e^{-1/366} e^{-2/366} \cdots e^{-(n - 1)/366} \\
&= e^{-(1 + 2 + \cdots + (n - 1))/366} \\
&= e^{-\frac{(n - 1)n}{2}/366} 
\end{align*}
I'm using the inequality
\[
1 + x \leq e^x
\]
which comes from
\[
1 + x + \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \cdots = e^x
\]
Therefore the above inequality becomes
\[
1 - 
\left( 1 - \frac{1}{366} \right)  
\left( 1 - \frac{2}{366} \right)  
\cdots 
\left( 1 - \frac{n}{366} \right)
\geq 1 - e^{-\frac{(n-1)n}{2}/366}
\]
In that case for an $n$ such that
$1 - 
\left( 1 - \frac{1}{366} \right)  
\left( 1 - \frac{2}{366} \right)  
\cdots 
\left( 1 - \frac{n - 1}{366} \right)
$ is approximately $0.5$,
we have
\[
0.5 \approx 1 - e^{-\frac{(n-1)n}{2}/366}
\]
which gives us
\[
e^{-\frac{(n-1)n}{2}/366} \approx 0.5
\]
Taking natural logs,
\[
(n-1)n \approx (-\ln 0.5) \cdot 738
\]
and therefore
\[
n^2 - n + \ln 0.5 \cdot 738 \approx 0
\]
Solving the quadratic we get
\[
n \approx \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - 4 \ln 0.5 \cdot 738}}{2} = 23.1228\ldots
\]
(of course taking the positive root).

If instead of 366 days in a year,
if there are $N$ days in a year (say we're on a different planet),
then the minimum value of $n$ to reach about 0.5 is given by
\[
n \approx 
\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - 4 \ln 0.5 \cdot (2N)}}{2} 
=\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - 8N \ln 0.5}}{2} 
\]
taking the positive root of the quadratic equation.

\begin{ex}
Go through the above computation and tell me what is the approximate
$n$ so that the probability of finding a repeat birthday in randomly chosen
$n$ randomly chosen people is about 0.9.
Write a program and verify.
\qed
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
What is the smallest $n$ such that
the probability of finding two birthdays among $n$ people
which are either on the same day or one day apart.
\qed
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
What is the smallest $n$ such that in a group of $n$ randomly
chosen people, there are least 3 with the same birthdays.
\qed
\end{ex}




\subsection{Method: computation with random variables}

Assume there are $n$ people in the room.
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator rv that the $i$--th and $j$--th persons
have the same birth.
Therefore 
\[
E \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij} \right]
\]
is the number of people in the room whose birthday falls on the
same day as someone else in the room, without double-counting.
(Without double-counting means is John's birthday equals Tom,
then we count John,Tom as a matching pair \textit{once}.)

In more details, let $S = \{1, ..., 366\}^n$, i.e., the
set of $n$--tuples where each value of a tuple is taken from the set
$\{1, ..., 366\}$.
I'm assuming that there are 366 days per year.
Let $p : S \rightarrow \R$ be the uniform pdf on $S$, i.e.,
$p$ is the product of $n$ uniform pdfs on $\{1, ..., 366\}$.
Define $X : S \rightarrow \R$ as follows: let
$s = (s_1, ..., s_{366}) \in S$. Then
\[
X(s) = \text{number of $s_i$'s that equals some $s_j$
where $i < j$}
\]
We can also define $X_{ij} : S \rightarrow \R$ such that
for $s = (s_1, ..., s_n) \in S$,
\[
X_{ij}(s) =
\begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if $s_i = s_j$} \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
Then
\[
X =
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}
\]

Note that
\[
E \left[ X_{ij} \right] = \frac{1}{366}
\]
Why? Because
\[
E \left[ X_{ij} \right] = \sum_{s \in S} X_{ij}(s) p(s)
\]
and the only term that is nonzero is when $X_{ij}(s) = 1$
where $s_i = s_j$
and it's easy to see that in this case
$p(s) = 1/366$: For the case where $s_i = 1 = s_j$, there
are $366^{n-2}$ tuples,
for the case where $s_i = 2 = s_j$, there are
$366^{n-2}$ tuples, etc.
Therefore there are $365^{n-2} \cdot 365 = 365^{n-1}$ tuples
where $s_i = s_j$.
Therefore $p(s) = 365^{n-1}/|S| = 365^{n-1}/365^n = 1/365$.

There's another way to think about the above:
Let
\[
A
=
\{s \mid \text{there is some $i$ such that }
s_i = s_j \text{ for some $j > i$}\}
\]
Now for each $i$,
\[
A_i = \{s \mid s_i = s_j \text{ for some $j > i$}\}
\]
Then
\[
A = \dot{\bigcup}_{i=1}^n A_i
\]
(the union is disjoint).
Say there are 4 days in a year and there are 3 people.

}
Prob $p_1$ that person 1 shares a bday with someone:

Hence the number of pairs of people with non-unique birthdays is given by
\[
E \left[
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}
  \right]
  =
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} 
  E \left[X_{ij}\right]
  =
  \binom{n}{2}\frac{1}{366}
\]
Therefore for there to be at least a pair with the same birthdays is the
same as saying
\begin{align*}
     & \binom{n}{2} \frac{1}{366}  \geq 1 \\
\iff & \,\,\,\,\, \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \geq 366 \\
\iff & \,\,\,\,\, n(n-1)           \geq 2 \cdot 366 \\
\iff & \,\,\,\,\, n^2 - n - 2 \cdot 366 \geq 0\\
\end{align*}
The roots of $x^2 - x - 2 \cdot 366$ are
\[
x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 366}}{2}
\]
The positive root is approximately $27.56...$.
Therefore if there are at least 28 people, you will have a pair with
the same birthday.
Therfore
\begin{align*}
  E \left[
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}
  \right] \geq 1
\iff & \,\,\,\,\, n^2 - n - 2 \cdot 366 \geq 0\\
\iff & n \geq 28
\end{align*}

Let $n$ be the number of people who share the same birthday
and $N$ be the number of days.
Then the expected number of people who share a birthday with someone is
\[
n(1 - (1 - 1/N)^{n-1})
\]
So
\[
n(1 - (1 - 1/N)^{n-1}) \geq 1
\]
The graph shows that this happens with $n \geq 20$ (the value of the
expression is then 1.11823...)
Why is this not 23?

Note the difference:
\begin{tightlist}
  \item If there are 23 people, then the probability that there's a
  pair with the same birthdays is approximately $0.5$
  \item If there are 28 people, then the expected number of pairs
  of same birthdays is $\geq 1$.
\end{tightlist}

They sound the same, but in fact they are different (which is why the
above computation yields two different values or 23 and 28.)

The probability computation tells us that when you have 23 or more people
in a room, it's more likely that there is a pair of people with the same
birthday.
What about the expectation computation?
Let $p(i)$ denotes the probability that there
are exactly $i$ people each of
whom can be paired up with someone else who has the same birthday.
Then the probability that there is at least one pair with the same birthday is
then
\[
\sum_{i=2}^n p(i)
\]
The expectation computated above on the other hand is
\[
\sum_{i=0}^n p(i) \cdot i
\]
(Of course by definition $p(0) = p(1) = 0$. Right?)

Something's not right.
Consider a box with 6 red balls and 4 black balls.
The probability of picking a red is $6/10 > 0.5$.
The expectation of picking a red is $6/10 \cdot 1 + 4/10 \cdot 0 = 6/10$
and not 1.
Or consider the case where the box has $n$ red balls
and 4 black balls.
For the probability of picking a red is $n / (n + 4)$.
For this to be $> 0.5$, $n / (n + 4) > 0.5$
which give $2n > n + 4$ which is $n > 4$.
The expectation of picking a red is
$(n/(n+4)) \cdot 1 + (4/(n+4)) \cdot 0 = n/(n + 4)$.
For this to be $\geq 1$, we get $n/(n + 4) > 1$
which is impossible.


\subsection{From a website}

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true]
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/35791/birthday-problem-expected-number-of-collisions?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa!
\end{lstlisting}

Let $X$ be the r.v. for number of people with non-unique
birthdays.
In other words if $s = (s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n) \in S$,
then
\[
X(s)
=
|\{
s_i \mid 1 \leq i \leq n, \,\,\, s_i = s_j
\text{ for some $j \neq i$, $1 \leq j \leq n$}
\}|
\]
Let $X_i$ be
\[
X_i(s)
=
|\{
s_i \mid \,\,\, s_i = s_j
\text{ for some $j \neq i$, $1 \leq j \leq n$}
\}|
\]
Then
\[
X = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i
\]
Note that this does not count the number of \textit{pairs} of people
with same birthdays.
This counts the number of people.
For instance if $n = 2$ and $s = (1, 1)$,
then $X_1(s) = 1$ and $X_2(s) = 1$
since for this selection of people, both have Jan 1 as their birthdays.
This $X$ will give 2 while the $X$ from the previous section gives 1.


From website
\[
E[X] = np
\]
where
\[
p = n(1 - (1 - 1/N)^{n-1})
\]

Note that if we want to have one person with nonunique birthdays,
then we need $X \geq 2$.
So we need to find $n$ such that
\[
E[X] = n(1 - (1 - 1/366)^{n-1})
\]

Here's a program to find the $n$.
\begin{python}
N = 366
for n in range(1, 31):
    print n, n*(1 - (1 - 1.0/N)**(n-1))
    print
\end{python}
This means that $n$ have to be at least roughly 28 or 29 for
$X$ to achieve a value of 2.


\subsection{Comparing the above two methods}

The probability method: Find the smallest $n$ such that
\[
p = 1 -
\left(1 - \frac{1}{366}\right) \cdot 
\left(1 - \frac{2}{366}\right) \cdot
\cdots \cdot
\left(1 - \frac{365}{366}\right) > 0.5
\]
The expectation method: Find the smallest $n$ such that
\[
E[X] =
n
\left(
  1 - \left(1 -\frac{1}{366}\right)^{n-1}
\right)
\geq 2
\]


\subsection{Generalizations}

Let there be $n$ people.
They all have been given randomly given a value $v$ from
a set of size $k$.
What is the probability that there's at least one person
with a value $v$ that was also given to another person?
What is the expectation of number of people with non-unique $v$ value?
What is the probability that there is at least $m$ people with
non-unique $v$ value?

Suppose there are $n$ values $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$
where $v_i$ are taken randomly from a set with $k$ values.
There is the likelihood that there is a pair $v_i, v_j$,
$i \neq j$, which are the same.
