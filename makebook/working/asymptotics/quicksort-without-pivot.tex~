\section{Quicksort without pivot}

Maintain left and right subarrays so that max of left is $\leq$
min of right.
Need running largest 2 values in left and largest 2 values in right.

To prevent recursion: maintain is ascending for left
and is descending on right.
If is ascending on left -- do not recurse on left.
If is descending on right --  do not recurse on right.
So this partition method returns either a pivot index or
-1 for do not recurse left,
-2 for do not recurse right,
-3 for do not recurse both left and right.
