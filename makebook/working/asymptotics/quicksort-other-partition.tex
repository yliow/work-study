\section{Quicksort: Other Partition Strategies}

I've already shown you the first partition algorithm (PLTR).

Another method is to put the pivot at the right.
In other words, the organization of the array is:
\verb!left!, \verb!right!, \verb!TODO!, \verb!pivot!.
If you understand how to partition by putting the pivot on the leftmost
part of the array, then you should have no problems working with the pivot
on the rightmost side.

I'll leave it to you to trace some examples by hand.
Once you're comfortable with it, implement the algorithm.
