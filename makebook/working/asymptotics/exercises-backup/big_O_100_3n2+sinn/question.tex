Let 
\[
f(n) = 100 + 3n^2 + \sin(n)
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Plot the graphs of 
\begin{align*}
y &= 300 \\
y &= 3n^2 \\
y &= \sin(n)
\end{align*}
for $0 \leq n \leq 20$.
\item[(b)] From (a), which term of $f(n)$ grows the fastest
and therefore will ultimately control
the growth of $f(n)$ as $n$ keeps growing? 
\item[(c)] Compute the big-O of $f(n)$.
\end{itemize}
Note: Using graphs does not really provide a proof.
Big-$O$ requires you to say something about functions
for \textit{all} large values of $n$.
Your graph can only show a finite range of $n$.
Later I'll show you how to prove big-$O$ statements.
