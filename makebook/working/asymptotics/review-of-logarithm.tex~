\section{Review of Logarithm}

Here's the definition of logarithm:
\[
\log_a b = c
\]
if
\[
b = a^c
\]

For instance, since
\[
100 = 10^2
\]
we have
\[
\log_{10} (100) = 2
\]

\begin{ex}
What is $\log_{3} 81$?

\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
What is $\log_{4} 2$?
\qed
\end{ex}

The point of the logarithm is to simplify large numbers by focusing on powers
after the numbers are expressed as powers of a fixed base.
It works particularly well for products.
For instance if you look at this:
\[
100^{0.2} \cdot 10^{5 + x} = 100000000
\]
Notice that all numbers can be converted to base 10:
\[
(10^2)^{0.2} \cdot 10^{5 + x} = 10^8
\]
or
\[
10^{0.4} \cdot 10^{5 + x} = 10^8
\]
and therefore you get
\[
10^{0.4 + 5 + x} = 10^8
\]
from which you get the equation
\[
0.4 + 5 + x = 8
\]
Notice that this equation involves much smaller numbers than
\[
100^{0.2} \cdot 10^{5 + x} = 100000000
\]
With the concept of logarithm to base 10 this is exactly what you would get
if you use log-to-base-10 calculations with logarithm formulas like
\begin{itemize}
\li $\log_{10} (10) = 1$
\li $\log_{10}(ab) = \log_{10}(a) + \log_{10}(b)$
\li $\log_{10} (a^b) = b \log_{10}(a)$
\end{itemize}
\begin{align*}
\log_{10} (100^{0.2} \cdot 10^{5 + x}) &= \log_{10}(100000000) \\
\log_{10} (100^{0.2}) + \log_{10} (10^{5 + x}) &= \log_{10} 10^8 \\
\log_{10} (10^{0.4}) + \log_{10} (10^{5 + x}) &= 8 \log_{10} 10 \\
0.4 \log_{10} 10 + (5 + x)\log_{10} 10 &= 8 \\
0.4  + (5 + x) &= 8  \\
\end{align*}

\begin{thm} Here are some formulas for logarithms.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] $\log_b b = 1$
\item[(b)] $\log_b xy = \log_b x + \log_b y$
\item[(c)] $\log_b x^y = y \log_b x$
\item[(d)] $\log_b a = \frac{\log_c a}{\log_c b}$
\end{itemize}
\end{thm}

\begin{ex} [PUT THIS IN POLYNOMIAL CASE]
What is $x$ is $3^{x + 2} = $
\qed
\end{ex}
