\section{Mergesort}

Before I talk about $\mergesort$, I'll talk about $\merge$.
As I mentioned earlier, the $\mergesort$ uses $\merge$.

As I mentioned earlier, I want to use memory carefully, i.e., 
I do not want to create new arrays all the time.

Let's use
\[
x = [3, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 12, 15, 1, 5]
\]
as an example.
I know that $\mergesort$ splits $x$
into two halves.
Instead of using two array, I'm going to use indices
\begin{align*}
x &= [3, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 12, 15, 1, 5] \\
i = 0, j = 4 &: \text{to denote the left array $x[0..4]$} \\
j' = 5, k = 9 &: \text{to denote the right array $x[5..9]$}
\end{align*}
Of course $j'$ is redundant since $j' = j + 1$.
Note that in the mergesort algorithm, the two arrays which are merged
are contiguous, i.e., next to each other.
So it is true that $j' = j + 1$.

$[][3, 5, 7, 8, 12][1, 3, 5, 13, 15]$ (think of this as a contiguous single array)

1. $t = 3$, shift to get $[1][3, 5, 7, 8, 12][3, 5, 13, 15]$

2. Put $t$ into index 0: $[1][3, 5, 7, 8, 12][3, 5, 13, 15]$

For the next, choose left array to move over
$[1,3][5,7,8,12][3,5,13,15]$

$[1,3,3][5,7,8,12][5,13,15]$

$[1,3,3,5][7,8,12][5,13,15]$

$[1,3,3,5,5][7,8,12][13,15]$

$[1,3,3,5,5,7][8,12][13,15]$

$[1,3,3,5,5,7,8][12][13,15]$

$[1,3,3,5,5,7,8,12][][13,15]$

$[1,3,3,5,5,7,8,12,13][][15]$

$[1,3,3,5,5,7,8,12,13,15][][]$

What is the runtime?
If left length is $n/2$, runtime is $n^2 \cdot n/s$.

What is swap header is possible?

$[1,3][5,7,8,12][3,6,13,15]$ becomes
$[1,3][3,7,8,12][5,6,13,15]$ after swapping 5 and 3.

The problem is that the swapped header might make right half not sorted.

$[1,3][5,7,8,12][3,4,13,15]$ becomes
$[1,3][3,7,8,12][5,4,13,15]$ after swapping 5 and 3.

Need to perform one pass of bubblesort at worse
