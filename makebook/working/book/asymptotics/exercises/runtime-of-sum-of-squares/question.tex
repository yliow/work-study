The following computes the sum of squares from $1^2$ to $n^2$:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, fontsize=\small]
s = 0
for i = 1, ..., n:
    term = i * i
    s = s + term
\end{Verbatim}
Here's the program with goto statements and timing for each statement:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, fontsize=\small]
                             time
         i = 1               t1
         s = 0               t2
LOOP:    if i > n:           t3
             goto ENDLOOP    t4
         term = i * i        t5
         s = s + term        t6
         i = i + 1           t7
         goto LOOP           t8
ENDLOOP:
\end{Verbatim}
(a) Compute the time taken $T(n)$ as a function of $n$
with constants $t_1$, ..., $t_8$.

(b) Simplify the runtime function by giving names $A$, $B$, ...
to the constants of the function from (a).

(c) Fudge away the constants and write down the simplest $g(n)$ such 
that the time in (b) is a big-$O$ of your $g(n)$.
Your $g(n)$ should be either $n$ or $n^2$ or $n^3$ or ...

(d) What is the space complexity of the algorithm?
