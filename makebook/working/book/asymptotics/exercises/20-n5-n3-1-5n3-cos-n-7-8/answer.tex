(a)
Let $f_0(n) = 20 n^5/(n^3 + 1)$.
The following is a plot of $|f_0(n)|$ and $20n^2$:
\input{exercises/20-n5-n3-1-5n3-cos-n-7-8/graph1.tex}
We can't really tell that $|f_0(n)| \leq 20 n^2$.
But if we zoom in, we see that in the interval $[10, 10.1]$:
\input{exercises/20-n5-n3-1-5n3-cos-n-7-8/graph2.tex}
he blue graph of $20n^2$ is above the red graph of $f(n)$
on the interval $[10, 10.1]$.
By zooming in at different places on the positive part of the real
axis, we see that the blue graph is always above the red graph.
In fact
\[
|f_0(n)| \leq 20n^2
\]
for all $n > 0$.
This can be proven mathematically:
If $n > 0$, then
\[
n^3 < n^3 + 1
\]
Therefore
\[
\frac{1}{n^3 + 1} < \frac{1}{n^3}
\]
and hence
\[
20 \frac{n^5}{n^3 + 1} < 20 \frac{n^5}{n^3} = 20 n^2
\]
Therefore if we choose $C_0 = 20$ and $N_0 = 1$,
we see that for $n \geq N_0$,
\[
\left|
20 \frac{n^5}{n^3 + 1}
\right| 
\leq C_0
\left|
n^2
\right|
\]
i.e.,
\[
|f_0(n)| \leq C_0|g(n)|
\]
Hence
\[
f_0(n) = O(n^2)
\]

(b)
Let $f_1(n) = 5n^3\cos(n)$.
The following are plots of $|f_1(n)|$ (in red) and $5n^3$:
\input{exercises/20-n5-n3-1-5n3-cos-n-7-8/graph3.tex}
Since
\[
-1 \leq \cos(n) \leq 1
\]
for $n \geq 0$, we have
\[
-5n^3 \leq 5n^3 \cos(n) \leq 5n^3
\]
Therefore
\[
|5n^3 \cos(n)| \leq 5|n^3|
\]
Hence if I can choose $C_1 = 5$, $N_1 = 0$,
then for $n \geq N_1$,
\[
|5n^3 \cos(n)| \leq 5|n^3|
\]
i.e.,
\[
|f_1(n)| \leq 5|n^3|
\]
Therefore
\[
f_1(n) = O(5n^3)
\]

(c)
Let $f_2(n) = 7^8$.
The following are plots of $|f_2(n)|$ (in red) and $7^8n^0$:
\input{exercises/20-n5-n3-1-5n3-cos-n-7-8/graph4.tex}
The two graphs are the same.
If I set $C_2 = 7^8$ and $N_2 = 0$, then for $n \geq N_2$,
\[
|f_2(n)| \leq C_2|n^0|
\]
Therefore
\[
f_2(n) = O(n^0)
\]

(d) Let $C = \max(C_0, C_1, C_2) = \max(20, 5, 7^8) = 7^8$,
$N = \max(N_0, N_1, N_2) = \max(1, 0, 0) = 1$,
$k = \max(2, 3, 0) = 3$.

\input{exercises/20-n5-n3-1-5n3-cos-n-7-8/graph5.tex}

Note that the upper bound $7^8 n^3$ is not tight.
A tigher upper bound is $5n^3$.
Of course either way
\[
f(n) = O(n^3)
\]
\qed
